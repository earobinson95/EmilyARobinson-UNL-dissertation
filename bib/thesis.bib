	abstract = {The complexity of linear mixed-effects (LME) models means that traditional diagnostics are rendered less effective. This is due to a breakdown of asymptotic results, boundary issues, and visible patterns in residual plots that are introduced by the model fitting process. Some of these issues are well known and adjustments have been proposed. Working with LME models typically requires that the analyst keeps track of all the special circumstances that may arise. In this article, we illustrate a simpler but generally applicable approach to diagnosing LME models. We explain how to use new visual inference methods for these purposes. The approach provides a unified framework for diagnosing LME fits and for model selection. We illustrate the use of this approach on several commonly available datasets. A large-scale Amazon Turk study was used to validate the methods. R code is provided for the analyses. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {In statistical modeling, we strive to specify models that resemble data collected in studies or observed from processes. Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q–Q plots shows that de-trended Q–Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.},

In that time, technological changes have impacted both our charts and our testing methods, resulting in a dizzying array of charts, many different taxonomies to classify graphics, and several different philosophical approaches to testing the eﬀicacy of charts and graphs experimentally. Once rare, charts and graphical displays are now everywhere - but do they help us understand? In this paper we review the history of graphical testing across disciplines, discuss different direct approaches to testing graphics, and contrast direct tests with visual inference, which requires that the viewer determine both the question and the answer. Examining the last 100 years of graphical testing, we summarize best practices for creating effective graphics, acceptance of the results of graphical testing, and what the future holds for graphics and empirical testing of interactive statistical visualizations.},

	abstract = {Background. Many patients have difficulty interpreting risks described in statistical terms as percentages. Computer game technology offers the opportunity to experience how often an event occurs, rather than simply read about its frequency. Objective. To assess effects of interactive graphics on risk perceptions and decisions. Design. Electronic questionnaire. Participants and setting. Respondents (n = 165) recruited online or at an urban hospital. Intervention. Health risks were illustrated by either static graphics or interactive game-like graphics. The interactive search graphic was a grid of squares, which, when clicked, revealed stick figures underneath. Respondents had to click until they found a figure affected by the disease. Measurements. Risk feelings, risk estimates, intention to take preventive action. Results. Different graphics did not affect mean risk estimates, risk feelings, or intention. Low-numeracy participants reported significantly higher risk feelings than high-numeracy ones except with the interactive search graphic. Unexpectedly, respondents reported stronger intentions to take preventive action when the intention question followed questions about efficacy and disease severity than when it followed perceived risk questions (65\% v. 34\%; P {\textless} 0.001). When respondents reported risk feelings immediately after using the search graphic, the interaction affected perceived risk (the longer the search to find affected stick figures, the higher the risk feeling: r = 0.57; P = 0.009). Limitations. The authors used hypothetical decisions. Conclusions. A game-like graphic that allowed consumers to search for stick figures affected by disease had no main effect on risk perception but reduced differences based on numeracy. In one condition, the game-like graphic increased concern about rare risks. Intentions for preventive action were stronger with a question order that focused first on efficacy and disease severity than with one that focused first on perceived risk.

	abstract = {Objective. To examine the influence of numeracy on interpreting various risk communication formats. Design. A random sample of women (N = 266) completed a questionnaire assessing numeracy and risk perception of prenatal test results and results of colon cancer screening tests. The authors examined the relationships between risk level (high v. low) and format of risk presentation (ratio, pictogram, or Paling Perspective Scale) and whether these relationships differed based on the numeracy skills of the participant. 

Results. The authors identified a significant (P {\textless} 0.001) 3-way interaction between format, risk level, and numeracy: high-numerate participants in the low-risk group perceived the test results as less risky compared with participants in the high-risk group (P {\textless} 0.001) with the Paling Perspective Scale but not with the other formats. For lownumerate participants, they did not observe differences between low- and high-risk scenarios for any of the 3 formats. The results were similar for the Down syndrome and colon cancer scenarios. Overall, the pictogram resulted in significantly lower risk ratings compared with the Paling Perspective Scale and the ratio with numerator 1 (P {\textless} 0.001). 

Conclusion. Different communication formats may produce different risk perceptions, but the effect is qualified by patients’ numeracy skills.

	abstract = {Background. Quantitative risk information plays an important role in decision making about health. This study focuses on commonly used numerical and graphical formats and examines their effect on perception of different likelihoods and choice preferences. Methods. An experimental study was conducted with 192 participants, who evaluated 2 sets of 4 lotteries. Numerical formats to describe likelihood varied systematically between participants (X\%, X-in-100, or 1-in-X). The effect of  graphic formats (bar charts, icon charts) was assessed as a withinsubjects factor. Dependent measures included perceived likelihood, choice preferences about participating in the lottery, and processing times. Results. Numerical likelihoods presented as 1-in-X were processed fastest and were perceived as conveying larger likelihoods than the X-in-100 and percentages formats (mean response times in seconds: 5.65 v. 7.31 and 6.50; mean rating on a 1–9 scale: 4.38 v. 3.30 and 3.31, respectively). The 1-in-X format also evoked a stronger willingness to participate in a lottery than the 2 other numerical formats. The effect of adding graphs on perceived likelihood was moderated by numerical aptitude. Graphs reduced ratings of perceived likelihood of participants with lower numeracy, while there was no overall effect for participants with higher numeracy. Conclusion. Perception of likelihood differs significantly depending on the numerical format used. The 1-in-X format yields higher perceived likelihoods and it appears to be the easiest format to interpret. Graphs primarily affect perception of likelihood of people with lower numerical aptitude. These effects should be taken into account when discussing medical risks with patients.

Numerical magnitude development involves gaining increasingly precise knowledge of increasing ranges and types of numbers: from nonsymbolic to small symbolic numbers, from smaller to larger whole numbers, and from whole to rational numbers. One reason why this development is important is that precision of numerical magnitude knowledge is correlated with, predictive of, and causally related to both whole and rational number arithmetic. Rational number arithmetic, however, also poses challenges beyond understanding the magnitudes of the individual numbers. Some of these challenges are inherent; they are present for all learners. Other challenges are culturally contingent; they vary from country to country and classroom to classroom. Generating theories and data that help children surmount the challenges of rational number arithmetic is a promising and important goal for future numerical development research.},

In addition, users should be aware of potential attacks in order to minimize or negate their effect. These attacks target the information visualization system as well as the perceptual, cognitive and motor capabilities of human end users. To identify and help counter these attacks we present a framework for information visualization system security analysis, a taxonomy of visualization attacks and technology independent principles for countering malicious visualizations. These themes are illustrated with case studies and working examples from the network security visualization domain, but are widely applicable to virtually any information visualization system.},

information in innovative ways , most notably by exploring multimedia environments
and by manipulating three-dimensional virtual worlds . Many benefits have been
claimed for this new kind of interactivity , a general assumption being that learning
and cognitive processing are facilitated . We point out , however , that little is known
about the cognitive value of any graphical representations , be they good oldfashioned
(e . g . diagrams) or more advanced (e . g . animations , multimedia , virtual
reality) . In our paper , we critique the disparate literature on graphical representations
, focusing on four representative studies . Our analysis reveals a fragmented and
poorly understood account of how graphical representations work , exposing a
number of assumptions and fallacies . As an alternative we propose a new agenda for
graphical representation research . This builds on the nascent theoretical approach
within cognitive science that analyses the role played by external representations in
relation to internal mental ones . We outline some of the central properties of this
relationship that are necessary for the processing of graphical representations .
Finally , we consider how this analysis can inform the selection and design of both
traditional and advanced forms of graphical technology .},

Fifty-ﬁve undergraduates provided written descriptions of data for a set of 14 line or bar graphs, half of which depicted variables familiar to the population and half of which depicted variables unfamiliar to the population. Participants then took a test of graphicacy skills. As predicted, the format inﬂuenced viewers’ interpretations of data. Speciﬁcally, viewers were more likely to describe x–y interactions when viewing line graphs than when viewing bar graphs, and they were more likely to describe main effects and ‘‘z–y’’ (the variable in the legend) interactions when viewing bar graphs than when viewing line graphs. Familiarity of data presented and individuals’ graphicacy skills interacted with the inﬂuence of graph format. Speciﬁcally, viewers were most likely to generate inferences only when they had high graphicacy skills, the data were familiar and thus the information inferred was expected, and the format supported those inferences. Implications for multivariate data display are discussed.},

An even stronger connection is drawn between the Weber–Fechner law and a Bayesian framework when neural storage or communication is the dominant concern, such as for numerosity. Theoretical results and experimental verification for perception of sound intensity are both presented.},

To model real-world data, the graphed data represented different underlying trends and included different sample sizes and amounts of variability. Six trends (increasing and decreasing linear, exponential, asymptotic) were presented on four graph types (histogram, line graph, scatterplot, suspended bar graph). The experiment assessed how these factors affect trend discrimination, with the overall goal of judging what types of graphs lead to better discrimination. Six participants (two psychology professors, four psychology graduate students) viewed graphs on a computer screen and identified the underlying trend. All participants were familiar with the types of trends presented and were aware of the purpose of the experiment. Analysis indicated higher accuracy when variability was lower and sample size was higher. Choice accuracy was higher for nonlinear trends and was highest when line graphs were used.},

In this framework, plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests. Statistical significance of ‘discoveries’ is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of simulated datasets. A simple but rigorous protocol that provides inferential validity is modelled after the ‘lineup’ popular from criminal legal procedures. Another protocol modelled after the ‘Rorschach’ inkblot test, well known from (pop-)psychology, will help analysts acclimatize to random variability before being exposed to the plot of the real data. The proposed protocols will be useful for exploratory data analysis, with reference datasets simulated by using a null assumption that structure is absent. The framework is also useful for model diagnostics in which case reference datasets are simulated from the model in question. This latter point follows up on previous proposals. Adopting the protocols will mean an adjustment in working procedures for data analysts, adding more rigour, and teachers might find that incorporating these protocols into the curriculum improves their students’ statistical thinking.},

	abstract = {Mass media routinely present data on COVID-19 diffusion with graphs that use either a logarithmic scale or a linear scale. We show that the choice of the scale adopted on these graphs has important consequences on how people understand and react to the information conveyed. In particular, we find that when we show the number of COVID-19 related deaths on a logarithmic scale, people have a less accurate understanding of how the pandemic has developed, make less accurate predictions on its evolution, and have different policy preferences than when they are exposed to a linear scale. Consequently, merely changing the scale the data is presented on can alter public policy preferences and the level of worry about the pandemic, despite the fact that people are routinely exposed to COVID-19 related information. Providing the public with information in ways they understand better can help improving the response to COVID-19, thus, mass media and policymakers communicating to the general public should always describe the evolution of the pandemic using a graph on a linear scale, at least as a default option. Our results suggest that framing matters when communicating to the public.},

For example, students often unknowingly interpreted the log scale as linear and were confused about the order of magnitude of a value in the negative exponent region. To address these issues, we used the results of our findings to develop and implement a set of online “essential skills” tasks to help students achieve a core level of mastery and fluency in reading log plots, a basic and critical skill for engineers. The online tasks were administered as for-credit homework assigned several times throughout the semester, and students spent 10-20 minutes on each assignment. Results of post-tests indicate that with this minimal practice, students were able to dramatically improve their accuracy in reading log plots compared to a control group with no log plot practice. Furthermore, testing one month after training demonstrated that student continued to retain the learned skill. Future development will focus on making these essentials skills task broadly available online and further improving effectiveness and usability.},

	abstract = {As part of an experimental study of the effect of stopping iterative maximum likelihood calculations after one cycle, twenty-one scientists were asked to judge by eye the positions for a pair of parallel probit regression lines in a biological assay. This paper reports the results obtained from each pair of lines after one cycle of various forms of probit calculation. Although all the conditions of the experiment were chosen so as to be unfavourable to the drawing of good lines, one cycle of iteration brought every estimate within 11/2 per cent. of the maximum likelihood value, as compared with a range of 32 per cent. and a maximum error of 27 per cent. for the estimates read directly from the graphs. The fiducial limits as calculated after one cycle were brought within a range of about 5 per cent. around the true values. The subjects for this study were deliberately chosen as having no experience of probit methods. The results confirm me in the opinion I have often expressed, namely that, unless a diagram showing probits plotted against log dose is exceptionally irregular, a single cycle of iteration initiated by any reasonable trial regression line will give a satisfactory approximation. Experience in drawing the trial lines undoubtedly makes the first cycle better still, but even the inexperienced can do quite well. I am in no way suggesting that the critical faculty of the statistician is unnecessary in deciding when iteration may be stopped: care is needed in order to ensure that all doubtful cases have additional cycles, but users of the probit method may find some comfort in the thought that their trial lines are seldom as bad as they fear! When the form of calculation recently proposed by Cornfield and Mantel was used, results after one cycle were rather better, but, since those by the usual technique were so good, the practical advantage was not great. Additional calculations on some very extreme pairs of trial lines suggest that, if the data were so scanty or so irregular as to make the positions of the lines very uncertain, the Cornfield-Mantel procedure would then be markedly superior: in such circumstances, more than one cycle of iteration would certainly be needed, but this procedure might reduce the number of cycles. A further practical point in connection with data of this type is that an error of making the slopes of the trial lines too small is preferable to an error of making the slopes too large, since the latter is more likely to increase the number of cycles needed or even to make the iteration diverge.},

We identify transition points at which reducing the chart height results in significantly differing drops in estimation accuracy across the compared chart types, and we find optimal positions in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve at which viewers performed quickly without attendant drops in accuracy. Based on these results, we propose approaches for increasing data density that optimize graphical perception.},

	abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing
such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it inchides both theory and experimentation
to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The
second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion
is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

Although there are many guidelines for climate communication, there is little empirical evidence of their efficacy, whether for dispassionately explaining the science or for persuading people to act in more sustainable ways. Moreover, climate communication faces new challenges as assessments of climate-related changes confront uncertainty more explicitly and adopt risk-based approaches to evaluating impacts. Given its critical importance, public understanding of climate science deserves the strongest possible communications science to convey the practical implications of large, complex, uncertain physical, biological and social processes. Here, we identify the communications science that is needed to meet this challenge and the ambitious, interdisciplinary initiative that its effective application to climate science requires.},
