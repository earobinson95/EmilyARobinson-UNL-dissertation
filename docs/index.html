<p class="author"><em>Emily Anna Robinson</em></p>
<div class="abstract">
<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
<p>Log scales are often used to display data over several orders of magnitude within one graph. Three graphical experimental tasks were conducted to evaluate the impact displaying data on the log scale has on human perception of exponentially increasing trends compared to displaying data on the linear scale. The first experiment evaluates whether our ability to perceptually notice differences in exponentially increasing trends is impacted by the choice of scale. Participants were shown a set of plots and asked to identify which plot appeared to differ most from the other plots. Results indicated that when there was a large difference in exponential curves, the choice of scale had no impact and participants accurately differentiated between the two curves on both the linear and log scale. However, displaying exponentially increasing data on a log scale improved the accuracy of differentiating between exponentially increasing curves with slight differences. An exception occurred when identifying an exponential curve from curves closely resembling a linear trend, indicating it is easy to identify a curve in a group of lines but much harder to identify a line in a group of curves. The other experimental tasks focus on determining whether there are cognitive disadvantages to log scales: do log scales make it harder to make use of graphical information? To test an individual’s ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data, participants were asked to draw a line using their computer mouse through an exponentially increasing trend shown on both the linear and log scale. Results showed that when exponential growth rate is large, underestimation of exponential growth occurs when making predictions on a linear scale and there is an improvement in accuracy of predictions made on the log scale. The last experimental task is designed to test an individuals’ ability to translate a graph of exponentially increasing data into real value quantities and make comparisons of estimates. The results of the three experimental tasks provide guidelines for readers to actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw in order to ensure their charts are effective at communicating the intended result.</p>

<p>Advanced technology and computing power have promoted data visualization as a central tool in modern data science. <span class="citation">Unwin (2020)</span> defines data visualization as the art of drawing graphical charts in order to display data.
Graphics are useful for data cleaning, exploring data structure, and have been an essential component in communicating information for the last 200 years <span class="citation">(Lewandowsky &amp; Spence, 1989)</span>
During the <span class="math inline">\(\text{18}^{\text{th}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{19}^{\text{th}}\)</span> centuries, governments began using graphics in order to better understand their population and economic interests <span class="citation">(Harms, 1991; Playfair, 1801; Walker et al., 2013)</span>.
In , <span class="citation">Playfair (1801)</span> visually represents the power and economic status of each European Nation in the early <span class="math inline">\(\text{19}^{\text{th}}\)</span> century.
Circle size and numeric annotation within the circle indicate the number of square miles in each country with the number of people per square mile indicated above the circle.
The vertical bar to the left side represents the number of inhabitants (millions), and the line to the right side represents the revenue (million pounds).
Color in the original figure, not shown, identifies countries as maritime powers or powerful by land only.
The Statistical atlas of the United States <span class="citation">(Walker et al., 2013)</span> used charts and graphics to display data compiled from the 1870 US census.
displays the population of each state where square size represents the proportion of the states population separated into three regions representing the origin and race of the population.
The rectangle shown to the right represents the proportion of residents born in the state who have become residents of other states.
In the <span class="math inline">\(\text{20}^{\text{th}}\)</span> century, companies began utilizing graphics to understand their mechanics and support business decisions and news sources began displaying graphics of weather forecasts as a means to communicate critical information and aid in decision-making <span class="citation">(Chandar, Collier, &amp; Miranti, 2012; Yates, 1985)</span>.
<span class="citation">Chandar et al. (2012)</span> illustrates how AT&amp;T used graphics to demonstrate management’s ability to optimize utilization of assets by making comparisons between their annual net telephone revenues and their returns on total assets .
<!-- \svp{Might want to add a set of pictures showing the different types of graphics from this sentence - playfair's balance of trade, statistical atlas, and something from e.g. early IBM?}.  -->
Today, we encounter data visualizations everywhere; researchers include graphics to communicate their results in scientific publications and mass media present graphics in order to convey news stories to the public through newspapers, TV, and the Web <span class="citation">(Aisch et al., 2016; Gouretski &amp; Koltermann, 2007; Silver, 2020)</span>.
<!-- @natesilver538_2020 tracked the 2020 US presidential election by communicating results of their forecast model to the public through a variety of interactive visualizations including a bar chart, snake chart, and electoral college maps. --></p>

<p>Although statistical graphics have become widely used and valued in science, business, and in many other aspects of life, as creators of graphics, we are too accepting of them as default without asking critical questions about the graphics we create or view <span class="citation">(Unwin, 2020)</span>.
<span class="citation">Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann (2020)</span> poses the general question we must ask ourselves, “how effective is this graph at communicating useful information?”
<!-- \rh{what do you/they mean by effective? you use "effective" later too so it is imortant to define or provide some examples/counter examples.} -->
An effective graphic accurately shows the data through the appropriate chart selection, axes and scales, and aesthetic design choices in order to successfully communicate the intended result.
<!-- [Section 1.2](#misleading-graphics) illustrates how graphics can be misleading and ineffective at communicating the intended result by inaccurately displaying the data. -->
<!-- \ear{will add this section after prelims} --></p>
<p>Higher quality of technology has influenced the creation, replication, and complexity of graphics as there are an infinitely many number of graphical displays and design choices that can be implemented at faster speeds with more flexibility.
The creator of a graphic makes decisions about the variables displayed, the type of graphic, the size of the graphic and the aspect ratio, the colors and symbols used, the scales and limits, and the ordering of categorical variables.
In response to the increasing number of design choices, consistent themes and higher standards are being placed on graphics.
Selecting from an extensive list of styles and choices of graphics in order to effectively communicate insights into the data is a challenging task.
A consistent concern is the lack of theory of graphics available to build on; better theory should result in better graphics.
Creators of graphics need an established set of concepts and terminology to build their graphics from so they can actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw in order to ensure their charts are effective at communicating the intended result.</p>
<p>Many efforts have been made to provide guidelines for graphical designs including Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics <span class="citation">(Wilkinson, 2012)</span>.
The grammar of graphics serves as the fundamental framework for data visualization with the notion that graphics are built from the ground up by specifying exactly how to create a particular graph from a given data set.
Visual representations are constructed through the use of “tidy data” which is characterized as a data set in which each variable is in its own column, each observation is in its own row, and each value is in its own cell <span class="citation">(Hadley Wickham &amp; Grolemund, 2016)</span>.
Graphics are viewed as a mapping from variables in a data set (or statistics computed from the data) to visual attributes such as the axes, colors, shapes, or facets on the canvas in which the chart is displayed.
illustrates the process of creating a graphic from a data set through the use of variable mapping, data transformations, coordinate systems, and aesthetic features <span class="citation">(Vanderplas et al., 2020)</span>
Software, such as Hadley Wickham’s ggplot2 <span class="citation">(Hadley Wickham, 2011)</span>, aims to implement the framework of creating charts and graphics as the grammar of graphics recommends.</p>

<p>Despite past attempts to improve the use of graphics in science, graphics displayed in academic research are still falling short of the standards. <span class="citation">Gordon &amp; Finch (2015)</span> evaluated 97 graphs for overall quality, based on five principles of graphical excellence including: (1) show the data clearly (2) use simplicity in design (3) use good alignment on a common scale for quantities to be compared (4) keep the visual encoding transparent (5) use graphical forms consistent with principles 1 and 4.
The authors randomly sampled 97 graphs published in A* (top 5%) journals with work in statistics and applied science disciplines.
There were 50 graphs sampled from the most recently available issues of A* journals in applied sciences such as environmental sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, medical and health sciences, education, economics, and psychology.
The additional 47 graphs were randomly sampled from A* statistics journals.
Each graph was scored based on 60 features related to the five principles, such as proper axes labels.
Both authors assigned an overall quality rating (poor, adequate, good, or exemplary) to each of the graphs sampled; discussion between authors settled any discrepancies in ratings.
The authors rated 39% of the 97 graphs sampled as poor, indicating there is still an astonishing lack in the quality of graphics.
<!-- \rh{what type of graphs? how did they evaluate them?} -->
More startling is the fact that the source of the graphic from an applied science or a graphic from statistics had no effect on the quality of the graphic.
In efforts to achieve a higher standard of the graphics being presented, future work must be done to implement the academic research being conducted in graphics into practice.
<!-- \rh{Last sentence - I am not sure what you really want to say here.} -->
<!-- Better definitions of variables, units of measurements, scales, and other graphical elements is necessary in order to improve the overall quality of graphics.  -->

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Perceptual Process<a href="index.html#perceptual-process" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In order to develop guiding principles for generating graphics effective in communication, we must first understand the basic mechanics of the human perceptual system and the biases we are vulnerable to <span class="citation">(Goldstein &amp; Brockmole, 2017)</span>.
The perceptual process is a sequence of steps used to describe a how a stimulus in the environment leads to our perception of the stimulus and action in response to the stimulus .
This process is separated into sensation <span class="citation">(Carlson, 2010)</span> - involving simple processes that occur right at the beginning of a sensory system - and perception <span class="citation">(Myers &amp; DeWall, 2021)</span> - involving higher-order mechanisms and identified with more complex processes.</p>
<p>The perceptual process begins when there is a stimulus in the environment and light is reflected and focused back into the viewer’s eyes.
Within the eye, the light reflected is transformed and focused by the eye’s optical system and an image is formed on the receptors of the viewer’s retina.
It is important to note that everything a person perceives is based not on direct contact with stimuli but on representations of stimuli that are formed on the receptors and the resulting activity in the person’s nervous system.
Once light is reflected and focused, our visual receptors respond to the light and transform the light energy into electrical energy through a process called transduction.
Signals from the receptors are then transmitted through the retina, to the brain, and then within the brain where perception (what do you see?) and recognition (what is it called?) occur.
After recognition, viewers take some sort of motor action; for example, the viewer might move closer to the object.
The perceptual process is not direct and instead takes on more of a cyclic nature where a person may go through many iterations of stimuli, perception, recognition, and action before the final image is identified and understood <span class="citation">(M. A. Peterson, 1994)</span>.</p>

<p>When perception occurs, we first experience the <strong>preattentive stage</strong> in which we observe color, shape, size, and other basic information about the stimuli being perceived. Preattentive perception effects are automatically processed within the first 500 milliseconds of viewing and do not depend on sustained cognitive attention <span class="citation">(Vanderplas et al., 2020)</span>.
Following the preattentive stage, <strong>direct attention</strong> is required for additional processing to allow us to draw connections between components that assist in our interpretation of the stimuli.
When viewing a chart or graph, most insights we gain are due to the cognitive processes that occur after attention is focused on specific aspects of the graph.
<!-- The knowledge a viewer brings to the situation influences their cognitive evaluation of the stimuli. [@denes1993speech] -->
<!-- \svp{Citation? You should probably also provide a bit more context for this piece of the paragraph instead of ending with dropping this one fact...} \rh{Agreed.} --></p>
<p>The relationship between physiology and perception can provide us information about how graphics may be understood and interpreted.
<!-- \rh{How?} -->
Through experimentation, the physiological response (automatic reaction) is related to the behavioral response (perception, recognition, and action).
For example, <span class="citation">Furmanski &amp; Engel (2000)</span> tested behavioral responses with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to show that the the human visual system is more sensitive to horizontal and vertical stimuli than to stimuli at other orientations.
According to a cognitive analysis, graph interpretation involves (a) relatively simple pattern perception and association processes in which viewers can associate graphic patterns to quantitative referents and (b) more complex and error-prone inferential processes in which viewers must mentally transform data <span class="citation">(Shah, Mayer, &amp; Hegarty, 1999)</span>.
<span class="citation">Shah &amp; Carpenter (1995)</span> established the process in which viewers interact with charts by first perceptually observing the visual features and later translating to cognitive processing of the information depicted by those features.
A viewer must first encode the visual array by identifying meaningful visual features (for example, a straight light slanting downward).
Next, the viewer must classify the quantitative measures and relationships in which those visual features illustrate (for example, a decreasing linear relationship between x and y).
The last step involves translating the quantitative measures and relationships to the variables defined in the data set (for example, a population decreasing over years).
Psychophysics, the branch of psychology that deals with the relationships between physical stimuli (for example, light) and mental phenomena, aims to provide explanations of the relationship between physiology and perception and point out human perceptual biases.
By examining both behavior and physiology together, we are able to understand the mechanisms responsible for perception.</p>

<!-- \rh{Is there a reference for the actual "Weber's Law"? Please provide more connection between your text and the "Weber's Law".} -->
<p>Ernst Weber, an early psychophysics researcher, discovered a phenomenon known as Weber’s law, by determining the relationship between the difference threshold (smallest detectable difference between two sensory stimuli; known as the “Just Noticeable Difference”) and the magnitude of a stimulus <span class="citation">(Fechner, 1860)</span>.
This holds true for a variety of stimuli such as weight, light, and sound as well as for a range of magnitudes; larger numbers require a proportional larger difference in order to remain equally discriminate <span class="citation">(Dehaene, Izard, Spelke, &amp; Pica, 2008)</span>.
Known as <strong>Weber’s law</strong>, it was established that we do not notice absolute changes in stimuli, but instead that we notice the relative change <span class="citation">(Sun, Wang, Goyal, &amp; Varshney, 2012)</span>.
Numerically, Weber’s Law is defined as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta S}{S} = K
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S\)</span> represents the difference threshold, S represents the initial stimulus intensity, and K is called Weber’s contrast which remains constant as the magnitude of S changes.
Gustav Fechner, a founder of psychophysics, provided further extension to Weber’s law by discovering the relationship between the perceived intensity is logarithmic to the stimulus intensity when observed above a minimal threshold of perception <span class="citation">(Sun et al., 2012)</span>.
Formally known as the Weber-Fechner law, it is derived from Weber’s law as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
P = K\ln \frac{S}{S_0}

<!-- \rh{can you provide references? Especially for the examples?} -->
These tests may take many forms: identifying differences in graphs, accurately reading information off a chart, using data to make correct real-world decisions, or predicting the next few observations.
All of these types of tests require different levels of use and manipulation of the information presented in the chart.</p>
<p>The initial push to develop classification and recommendation systems for charts was grounded on heuristics rather than on experimentation <span class="citation">(Kruskal, 1975; Macdonald-Ross, 1977)</span>.
Request were made for the validation of the perception and utility of statistical charts through graphical experiments.
Initial experiments struggled with methodological issues <span class="citation">(Croxton &amp; Stein, 1932; Croxton &amp; Stryker, 1927; Eells, 1926)</span> with most early experimentation stemming from psychophysics research on the perception of size and shape <span class="citation">(Teghtsoonian, 1965)</span>.
<!-- \rh{"struggled with methodological issues" - examples?} -->
In attempts to understand the human perception and judgment of component parts, <span class="citation">Eells (1926)</span> instructed students to think of each circle diagram as representing 100% and write their best estimate of the percentage of the whole in each sector.
Participants were told not to hurry, but to work steadily in order to determine efficiency of judgment.
Students were then asked to analyze their mental processes used to make their estimates and indicate the method that best matches: by areas of sectors, by central angles, by arcs on the circumference, by subtending chords.
This process was repeated three days later by presenting students the same data represented in bar diagrams .
Results of the study led the authors to argue for the use of circle diagrams to show component parts based on both participant accuracy and speed.
In response, <span class="citation">Croxton &amp; Stryker (1927)</span> evaluated the accuracy of judgment of two types of charts (bars and circles) in efforts to reach a consistent conclusion.
During class, students were individually presented pairs of diagrams (without scales) on cards and asked to estimate the percentages displayed in the diagram.
It was found that the bar was preferable to the circle when shown percentages that deviate from quarters, but that the circle is strongly preferred when shown percentages separating the diagrams into 25% or 50%.</p>

<!-- \rh{Examples?} -->
In attempts to understand the visual psychophysics of simple graphical elements, <span class="citation">Spence (1990)</span>, presented stimuli (tables, lines - horizontal and vertical, bars, boxes, cylinders, pie charts, and disk charts) to participants on a monitor screen in a computer lab.
Participants were asked to use their cursor to position the marker to indicate the proportion to the apparent sizes of the elements .
Results found that the table elements (numbers), pie elements, and bar elements led to the most accurate proportion estimates; boxes and disk elements resulted in the least accurate estimates.
Measuring the speed at which participants made their judgments, it was found that two- and three- dimensional stimuli (for example, pie charts and box charts) assisted in faster judgment than zero- or one- dimensional stimuli (for example, tables and lines).</p>

<p>Cognitive psychologists and statisticians made progress by conducting experiments to identify perceptual errors associated with different styles of graphics and charts <span class="citation">(Cleveland &amp; McGill, 1984, 1985; Shah et al., 1999)</span>.
<!-- \rh{Examples?} -->
<span class="citation">Cleveland &amp; McGill (1984)</span> provides a basis for perceptual judgment, still utilized today, by examining six basic aesthetic design choices: position along a common scale, position along nonaligned scales, length, angle, slope, and area.
<span class="citation">Shah et al. (1999)</span> established the notion that redesigning graphs can result in the improvement of the viewer’s interpretation of the data.
For example, the use of gestalt principles <span class="citation">(Goldstein &amp; Brockmole, 2017)</span> such as proximity, similarity, and good continuation can help minimize the inferential processes and maximize the pattern association processes required to interpret relevant information.</p>
<p>These later experiments followed similar methodology as early studies by asking participants to read information directly from the charts and provide a quantitative estimate or answer a predefined question; as with the early studies, accuracy and response time were evaluated <span class="citation">(Amer, 2005; Broersma &amp; Molenaar, 1985; Dunn, 1988; L. V. Peterson &amp; Schramm, 1954; Tan, 1994)</span>.
<!-- \svp{provide some examples of quantitative estimation questions -- this will better support Ch4} -->
<!-- \svp{relate these examples to their implications - i.e. quantitative translation} -->
<span class="citation">Spence (1990)</span> presents four example questions for comparing the sizes of individual graphical elements: (1) How much greater was the rainfall in September than May? (2) Is the price of oil in constant dollars increasing or decreasing from year to year? (3) Do more people subscribe to Time than Newsweek? and (4) Did the ABC Corporation pay the largest dividends last year, or did XYZ?
<span class="citation">Amer (2005)</span> demonstrates that visual illusion may bias decision making and graph comprehension, even if the graphs are constructed according to best practice.
Participants were presented a cost volume profit graph with two crossing lines (revenue and cost) and asked to estimate three values: (1) the amount of total revenues on the ordinate corresponding to the endpoint of the total-revenue line plotted on the graph (2) the amount of total costs on the ordinate corresponding to the endpoint of the total-cost line plotted on the graph and (3) the amount of costs/revenues on the ordinate at the break even point—the point where the two lines cross.
Results indicate that decision makers may consistently underestimate or overestimate the values displayed on line graphs due to what is called the “Poggendorff illusion.”
In <span class="citation">Dunn (1988)</span>, participants were shown two maps, an unclassed choropleth map and a framed rectangle chart, indicating the murder rate of each US state .
The goal of the study was to assess the relative accuracy with which quantitative information is extracted from both types of charts.
Participants were strictly informed that the experiment was designed to test the ability of individuals to “read” or “decode” statistical maps and asked to write down their estimate of the murder rate as accurately as possible beside the 24 named states.
Results indicate that subjects found it easier to extract quantitative information from the framed rectangle chart than from the unclassed choropleth map and that the between individual variability in the choropleth map was related to the area of the state.</p>

<p>During the <span class="math inline">\(\text{21}^{\text{st}}\)</span> century, there have been advancements in the methodology used to investigate the effectiveness of statistical charts <span class="citation">(Majumder, Hofmann, &amp; Cook, 2013)</span>.
<span class="citation">Buja et al. (2009a)</span> introduced the lineup protocol in which data plots are depicted and interpreted as statistics.
Supported by the grammar of graphics, a data plot can be characterized as a statistic, defined as, “a functional mapping of a variable or set of variables” <span class="citation">(Vanderplas et al., 2020)</span>.
This allows the data plot to be tested similar to other statistics, by comparing the actual data plot to a set of plots with the absence of any data structure we can test the likelihood of any perceived structure being significant.
The construction of data plots as statistics allow for easy experimentation, granting researchers the ability to compare the effectiveness of and understand the perception of different types of charts.
While the lineup protocol differs from methodology used in earlier studies, the focus is still on initial perception and graph comprehension with a relatively small amount of work conducted to understand the effect of design choices on higher cognitive processes such as learning or analysis <span class="citation">(Green &amp; Fisher, 2009)</span>.
<!-- \svp{This is in part because lineups only ask about perceived differences and do not test the actual ability to read information off of a graph accurately or the conclusions drawn from the graph.

Lineups serve as a powerful tool for testing <em>perceived</em> differences by eliminating ambiguous questions.
However, the lineup protocol is constrained by the inability to test higher order cognitive skills such as accurately reading information off of a graph or drawing conclusions from the graph, limiting their ability to be used for testing real-world applications.</p>

<p>When faced with data which spans several orders of magnitude, we must decide whether to show the data on its original scale (compressing the smaller magnitudes into relatively little area) or to transform the scale and alter the contextual appearance of the data.
One common solution is to use a log scale transformation to display data over several orders of magnitude within one graph.
The usefulness of the log scale in science is illustrated in <span class="citation">(Munroe, 2005)</span> showing the challenge of displaying the fuel energy density of Uranium along side other sources of fuel due to differences in magnitude of density.

Logarithms convert multiplicative relationships (for example, 1 &amp; 10 displayed 10 units apart and 10 &amp; 100 displayed 90 units apart) to additive relationships (for example, 1 &amp; 10 and 10 &amp; 100 both equally spaced along the axis), showing proportional relationships and linearizing power functions <span class="citation">(Menge et al., 2018)</span>.
They also have practical purposes, easing the computation of small numbers such as likelihoods and transforming data to fit statistical assumptions.
When presenting log scaled data, it is possible to use either un-transformed scale labels (for example, values of 1, 10 and 100 are equally spaced along the axis) or log transformed scale labels (for example, 0, 1, and 2, showing the corresponding powers of 10).

<p>We have recently experienced the benefits and pitfalls of using log scales as COVID-19 dashboards displayed
case count data on both the log and linear scale <span class="citation">(Burn-Murdoch et al., 2020; Fagen-Ulmschneider, 2020)</span>.
<!-- \rh{I think providing examples (specific examples) is necessary. Also when to use log vs linear? Please provide references \& examples!} -->
In spring 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were large magnitude discrepancies in case counts at a given time point between different geographic regions (for example states and provinces as well as countries and continents).
During this time, we saw the usefulness of log scale transformations showing case count curves for areas with few cases and areas with many cases within one chart.
The usefulness of log scales in comparing deaths attributed to COVID-19 between countries as of March 2020 is illustrated in ; the diagonal reference lines provide a visual aid useful for interpretation <span class="citation">(Burn-Murdoch et al., 2020)</span>.
As the pandemic evolved, and the case counts were no longer spreading exponentially, graphs with linear scales seemed more effective at spotting early increases in case counts that signaled more localized outbreaks. In and , the daily case counts as of June 30, 2020 are displayed on both the linear and log scales respectively <span class="citation">(Burn-Murdoch et al., 2020)</span>.
The effect of the linear scale appears to evoke a stronger reaction from the public than the log scale as daily case counts are clearly rising rapidly during the summer wave.
This is only one recent example of a situation in which both log and linear scales are useful for showing different aspects of the same data.
There are long histories of using log scales to display results in ecology, psychophysics, engineering, and physics <span class="citation">(Heckler, Mikula, &amp; Rosenblatt, 2013; Menge et al., 2018)</span>
In <span class="citation">Waddell (2005)</span>, comparisons were made between the linear and logarithmic scales for the relationship between dosage and carcinogenicity in rodents.
Results favored the use of logarithmic scales for doses in order to put the relative doses into perspective whereas using a linear scale to administer doses to animals with the same chemicals to which humans are exposed does not provide useful, comparative information.
Given the widespread use of logarithmic scales, it is important to understand the implications of their use in order to provide guidelines for best use.

<!-- \svp{You might start this out by pointing out that while logarithms seem unnatural at first, we learn to count by ones, tens, and hundreds -- that is, in a base10 order of magnitude system. Then you can transition to research showing one, two, 10 and log-number scales.} -->
<p>When we first learn to count, we begin counting by ones (for example, 1, 2, 3, etc.), then by tens (for example, 10, 20, 30, etc.), and advancing to hundreds (for example, 100, 200, 300, etc.), following the base10 order of magnitude system (for example, 1, 10, 100, etc.).
Research suggests our perception and mapping of numbers to a number line is logarithmic at first, but transitions to a linear scale later in development, with formal mathematics education <span class="citation">(Dehaene et al., 2008; Siegler &amp; Braithwaite, 2017, 2017; Varshney &amp; Sun, 2013)</span>.
For example, a kindergartner asked to place numbers one through ten along a number line would place three close to the middle, following the logarithmic perspective <span class="citation">(Varshney &amp; Sun, 2013)</span>; demonstrates how a kindergartner might map numbers along a number line.
<!-- \svp{Might be worth showing this graphically if you can reproduce pics from the paper...} -->
<span class="citation">Dehaene et al. (2008)</span> found that with basic training, members of remote cultures with a basic vocabulary and minimal education understood the concept that numbers can be mapped into a spacial space; for example, numbers can be mapped to a number line or numbers can be mapped onto a clock.
<!-- \rh{Please explain.} -->
There was a gradual transition from logarithmic to linear scale as the mapping of whole number magnitude representations transitioned from a compressed (approximately logarithmic) distribution to an approximately linear one.
These results indicate the universal and cultural-dependent characteristics of the sense of number.</p>

<p>Assuming there is a direct relationship between perceptual and cognitive processes, it is reasonable to assume numerical representations should also be displayed on a nonlinear, compressed number scale. Therefore, if we perceive logarithmically by default, it is a natural (and presumably low effort) way to display information and should be easy to read and understand/use.
The idea is compression enlarges the coding space, thus increasing the dynamic range of perception and firing neurons within our visual system <span class="citation">(Nieder &amp; Miller, 2003)</span>.
Similar to the training and education required to transition from logarithmic mapping to linear mapping, there is also necessary training required in the assessment of graphical displays associated with logarithmic scales. <span class="citation">Haemer &amp; Kelley (1949)</span> identify semi-logarithmic charts for temporal series as requiring a certain degree of technical training.</p>

<p>People with diverse backgrounds can interpret the same display of data in vastly different ways; <span class="citation">(von Bergmann, 2021)</span> illustrates how individuals in public health interpret exponential growth distinctly different from scientists during early, middle, and late stages of growth.
Exponential growth is often misjudged in early stages, appearing to have a small growth rate.
As exponential growth continues, the middle stage appears to be growing, but not at an astounding rate, appearing more quadratic.
It is not until late stages of exponential growth when it is quite apparent that there is exponential growth occurring.
This misinterpretation can lead to decisions made under inaccurate understanding causing future consequences.</p>
<p>Early studies explored the estimation and prediction of exponential growth and found that growth is underestimated when presented both numerically and graphically <span class="citation">(Wagenaar &amp; Sagaria, 1975)</span>.
Results indicated that numerical estimation is more accurate than graphical estimation for exponential curves.
Experimental studies were conducted in order to determine strategies to improve the accuracy of estimation of exponential growth <span class="citation">(Jones, 1977; Mackinnon &amp; Wearing, 1991; Wagenaar &amp; Sagaria, 1975)</span>.
There was no improvement in estimation found when participants had contextual knowledge or experience with exponential growth, but instruction on exponential growth reduced the underestimation; participants adjusted their initial starting value but not their perception of the growth rate <span class="citation">(Jones, 1977; Wagenaar &amp; Sagaria, 1975)</span>.
<span class="citation">Mackinnon &amp; Wearing (1991)</span> found that estimation was improved by providing immediate feedback to participants about the accuracy of their current predictions.</p>
<p>Our inability to accurately predict exponential growth might also be addressed by log transforming the data, however, this transformation introduces new complexities; most readers are not mathematically sophisticated enough to intuitively understand logarithmic math and translate that back into real-world effects.
In <span class="citation">Menge et al. (2018)</span>, ecologists were surveyed to determine how often ecologists encounter log scaled data and how well ecologists understand log scaled data when they see it in the literature.
Participants were presented three relationships displayed on linear-linear scales, log-log scales with untransformed values, or log–log scales with log transformed values .
The authors propose three types of misconceptions participants encountered when presented data on log-log scales: ‘hand-hold fallacy’, ‘Zeno’s zero fallacy’, and ‘watch out for curves fallacies’.
These misconceptions are a result of linear extrapolation assuming that a line in log-log space represents a line instead of the power law (which is an exponential relationship) in linear-linear space.</p>

</p>
</div>
<!-- \svp{You might take a whack at illustrating some of these fallacies} -->
<!-- \rh{Menge's example should be visually illustrated.} -->
<p>The ‘hand-hold fallacy’ stems from the misconception that steeper slopes in log-log relationships are steeper slopes in linear-linear space, illustrated in d-f. 
In fact, it is not only the slope that matters, but also the intercept and the location on the horizontal axis since a line in log-log space represents a power law in linear-linear space (linear extrapolation).
Emerging from ‘Zeno’s zero fallacy’ is the misconception that positively sloped lines in log-log space can imply a non-zero value of y when x is zero, illustrated in a-c and d-f.
This is never true as positively sloped lines in log-log space actually imply that y = 0 when x = 0. This misconception again is a result of linear extrapolation assuming that a line in log-log space represents a line instead of the power law in linear-linear space.
The last misconception, ‘watch out for curves fallacies’ encompasses three faults: (1) lines in log-log space are lines in linear-linear space, illustrated in d-f, (2) lines in log-log space curve upward in linear-linear space, illustrated in d-f, and (3) curves in log-log space have the same curvature in linear-linear space, illustrated in g-i.
Linear extrapolation is again responsible for the first and third faults while the second fault is a result of error in thinking that log-log lines represent power laws, and all exponential relationships curve upward; this is only true when the log-log slope is greater than one.
<span class="citation">Menge et al. (2018)</span> found that in each of these scenarios, participants were confident in their incorrect responses, indicating incorrect knowledge rather than a lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>In my research, I conduct three graphical experimental tasks to evaluate the impact displaying data on the log scale has on human perception of exponentially increasing trends compared to displaying data on the linear scale.
The first experiment evaluates whether our ability to perceptually notice differences in exponentially increasing trends is impacted by the choice of scale. I conducted a visual inference experiment in which participants were shown a series of lineups and asked to identify the plot that differed most from the surrounding plots.
The other experimental tasks focus on determining whether there are cognitive disadvantages to log scales: do log scales make it harder to make use of graphical information?
To test an individual’s ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data, participants were asked to draw a line using their computer mouse through an exponentially increasing trend shown on both the linear and log scale.
In addition to differentiation and prediction of exponentially increasing data, an experimental task was conducted to test an individuals’ ability to translate a graph of exponentially increasing data into real value quantities and extend their estimations by making comparisons.
The results of the three experimental tasks provide guidelines for readers to actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw, according to some set of design choices, to ensure their charts are effective.</p>
<!-- \svp{Things that seem to be missing: 1) Cleveland and McGill - hierarchy of accuracy in plot objects. You can think of e.g. exponentials as a series of tangential angles, which might help with explaining underestimation? 2) some literature explaining the different levels of complexity between perception, reading information off of a graph, predicting information, etc. - you should find this if only because it grounds the whole experiment in psychological theory (but you don't have to find it for your prelim)} -->
