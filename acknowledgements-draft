All of this would not have been possible without my incredible network and support system of friends, family, and mentors throughout the years. I want to thank everyone who encouraged me in any way along my graduate school journey.

I was fortunate to have been introduced to statistics by some amazing professors at Winona State University during my undergraduate degree. All of you invested in my future and gave me opportunities that built my foundation of statistical knowledge with activities outside the classroom and internship experiences. Dr. Tisha Hooks, thank you for being someone I know I can always count on for advice and Dr. Chris Malone, thank you for planting the small mustard seed of being a professor in my mind by telling me, "go to grad school and teach." Thank you to my friends and peers at WSU who showed me that doing homework is more fun with friends by your side.

During graduate school, I have had many wonderful mentors. To my advisors, Dr. Susan VanderPlas and Dr. Reka Howard, thank you for showing me that you can be both an unbelievable mother and a kick ass academic. Reka, thank you for giving me the freedom to explore and discover an area of statistics I am passionate about; you have been encouraging me from day one. Susan, thank you for sharing your world of graphics with me and continuing to push me to be a better researcher; I am looking forward to collaborating more in the future. To my committee members, Dr. Erin Blankenship and Dr. Heather Akin, thank you for your enthusiasm about my work and being a part of my Ph.D. program. To other prominent mentors, Dr. Kathy Hanford and Dr. Walter Stroup, thank you for training me to be a consultant and value collaborative work. Dr. Stroup, thank you for hiking a mountain with me at JSM and advising me not to trust anyone under 14,000 feet.

My family is a top notch bunch. To my parents and biggest fans, Wayne and Ann Robinson, thank you for always believeing in me and 

friends back home! Kaitlin, josey, jenny engesser

And lastly, I want to thank Dr. Taylor Alison Swift for making incredible music that got me through some long days and nights of writing.
