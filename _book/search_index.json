During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen both the benefits and the pitfalls of using log scales to display case counts. Three graphical experimental tasks were conducted to evaluate the impact our choice of scale has on human perception of exponentially increasing trends. The first experiment evaluates whether our ability to perceptually notice differences in exponentially increasing trends is impacted by the choice of scale. We conducted a visual inference experiment in which participants were shown a series of lineup plots (consisting of 19 null panels and 1 target panel) and asked to identify the panel that was most different from the others. Our results indicated that when there was a large difference in curvature between the target plot and null plots, the choice of scale had no impact and participants accurately differentiated between the two curves on both the linear and log scale. However, displaying exponentially increasing data on a log scale improved the accuracy of differentiating between models with slight curvature differences. An exception occurred when identifying a plot with curvature embedded in surrounding plots closely relating to a linear trend, indicating that it is easy to identify a curve in a group of lines but much harder to identify a line in a group of curves. The use of visual inference to identify these guidelines suggests that there are perceptual advantages to log scales when differences are subtle. Our other experimental tasks focus on determining whether there are cognitive disadvantages to log scales: do log scales make it harder to make use of graphical information? We conducted a graphical task similar to the New York Times You Draw It page to test an individuals ability to use and make predictions for exponentially increasing data. We asked participants to draw a line using their computer mouse through the increasing exponential trend shown on both scales. In addition to differentiation and prediction of exponentially increasing data, we conduct an experimental task to test an individuals ability to translate a graph of exponentially increasing data into real value quantities and extend their estimations by making comparisons. The results of our experimental tasks allow us to provide guidelines for readers to actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw, according to some set of design choices, to ensure that our charts are effective.

Unwin (2020) defines data visualization as the art of drawing graphical charts in order to display data. Graphics are useful for data cleaning, exploring data structure, and have been an essential component in communicating information for the last 200 years (Lewandowsky &amp; Spence, 1989) During the \\(\\text{18}^{\\text{th}}\\) and \\(\\text{19}^{\\text{th}}\\) centuries, governments began using graphics in order to better understand their population and economic interests(Harms, 1991; Playfair, 1801; Walker &amp; others, 2013). In , Playfair (1801) visually represent the power and economic status of each European Nation in the early \\(\\text{19}^{\\text{th}}\\) century. Circle size and numeric annotation within the circle indicate the number of square miles in each country with the number of people per square mile indicated above the circle. The vertical bar to the left side represents the number of inhabitants (millions), and the line to the right side represents the revenue (million pounds). Coloration in the original figure, not shown, identifies countries as maritime powers or powerful by land only. displays the population of each state as compiled from the 1870 US census (Walker &amp; others, 2013). Square size represents the proportion of the states population separated into three regions representing the origin and race of the population. The rectangle shown to the right represents the proportion of residents born in the state who have become residents of other states. In the \\(\\text{20}^{\\text{th}}\\) century, companies began utilizing graphics to understand their mechanics and support business decisions and news sources began displaying graphics of weather forecasts as a means to communicate critical information and aid in decision-making (Chandar, Collier, &amp; Miranti, 2012; Yates, 1985). Chandar, Collier, &amp; Miranti (2012) illustrates how AT&amp;T used graphics to demonstrate managements ability to optimize utilization of assets by making comparisons between their annual net telephone revenues and their returns on total assets . Today, we encounter data visualizations everywhere; researchers include graphics to communicate their results in scientific publications and mass media present graphics in order to convey news stories to the public through newspapers, TV, and the Web (Aisch et al., 2016; Gouretski &amp; Koltermann, 2007). Silver (2020) tracked the 2020 US presidential election by communicating results of their forecast model to the public through a variety of interactive visualizations including a bar chart, snake chart, and electoral college maps. Figure 1.1: William Playfairs balance of trate Figure 1.2: Statistical Atlas 1870 state population Figure 1.3: AT&amp;T utilization of assets Although statistical graphics have become widely used and valued in science, business, and in many other aspects of life, as creators of graphics, we are too accepting of them as default without asking critical questions about the graphics we create or view (Unwin, 2020). Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann (2020) poses the general question we must ask ourselves, how effective is this graph at communicating useful information? An effective graphic accurately shows the data through the appropriate chart selection, axes and scales, and aesthetic design choices in order to successfully communicate the intended result. Section 1.2 illustrates how graphics can be misleading and ineffective at communicating the intended result by inaccurately displaying the data. Higher quality of technology has influenced the creation, replication, and complexity of graphics as there are an infinitely many number of graphical displays and design choices that can be implemented at faster speeds with more flexibility. The creator of a graphic makes decisions about the variables displayed, the type of graphic, the size of the graphic and the aspect ratio, the colors and symbols used, the scales and limits, and the ordering of categorical variables. In response to the increasing number of design choices, consistent themes and higher standards are being placed on graphics. Selecting from an extensive list of styles and choices of graphics in order to effectively communicate insights into the data is a challenging task. A consistent concern is the lack of theory of graphics available to build on; better theory should result in better graphics. Creators of graphics need an established set of concepts and terminology to build their graphics from so they can actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw in order to ensure their charts are effective at communicating the intended result. Many efforts have been made to provide guidelines for graphical designs including Wilkinsons Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2012). The grammar of graphics serves as the fundamental framework for data visualization with the notion that graphics are built from the ground up by providing a way of specifying exactly how to create a particular graph from a given data set. Visual representations are constructed through the use of tidy data which is characterized as a data set in which each variable is in its own column, each observation is in its own row, and each value is in its own cell (Hadley Wickham &amp; Grolemund, 2016). Graphics are viewed as a mapping from variables in a data set (or statistics computed from the data) to visual attributes such as the axes, colors, shapes, or facets on the canvas in which the chart is displayed. illustrates the process of creating a graphic from a data set through the use of variable mapping, data transformations, coordinate systems, and aesthetic features (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020) Software, such as Hadley Wickhams ggplot2 (Hadley Wickham, 2011), aims to implement the framework of creating graphics as recommended in the grammar of graphics. Figure 1.4: Graphic flowchart Despite past attempts to improve the use of graphics in science, Gordon &amp; Finch (2015) evaluated 97 graphs for overall quality, based on five principles of graphical excellence including: (1) show the data clearly (2) use simplicity in design (3) use good alignment on a common scale for quantities to be compared (4) keep the visual encoding transparent (5) use graphical forms consistent with principles 1 and 4. This study randomly sampled 97 graphs published in A* (top 5%) journals with work in statistics and applied science disciplines. There were 50 graphs sampled from the most recently available issues of A* journals in applied sciences such as environmental sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, medical and health sciences, education, economics, psychology. The additional 47 graphs were randomly sampled from statistics A* journals. Each graph was scored based on 60 features related to the five principles, such as proper axes labels. Both authors assigned an overall quality rating (poor, adequate, good, or exemplary) to each of the graphs sampled; discrepancies in ratings were settled with discussion. The authors rated 39% of the 97 graphs sampled as poor indicating there is still an astonishing lack in the quality of graphics. More startling is the fact that the source of the graphic from an applied science or a statistics graphic had no effect on the quality of the graphic. In order to achieve a higher standard of the graphics being presented, future work must be done in order to implement the academic research being conducted in graphics into practice. 1.2 Misleading Graphics 1.3 Perception and Psychophysics In order to develop guiding principles for generating graphics effective in communication, we must first understand the basic mechanics of the human perceptual system and the biases we are vulnerable to (Goldstein &amp; Brockmole, 2017). The perceptual process is complex and involved . Figure 1.5: Perceptual process This process is broken down into sensation - involving simple processes that occur right at the beginning of a sensory system - and perception - involving higher-order mechanisms and identified with more complex processes. The perceptual process begins when there is a stimulus in the environment and light is reflected and focused back into the viewers eyes. Within the eye, the light reflected is transformed and focused by the eyes optical system and an image is formed on the receptors of the viewers retina. It is important to note that everything a person perceives is based not on direct contact with stimuli but on representations of stimuli that are formed on the receptors and the resulting activity in the persons nervous system. Once light is reflected and focused, our visual receptors respond to the light and transform the light energy into electrical energy through a process called transduction. Signals from the receptors are then transmitted through the retina, to the brain, and then within the brain where perception - what do you see? - and recognition - what is it called? - occur. After recognition, viewers take some sort of motor action - for example, move closer to the object. The perceptual process is not direct and instead takes on more of a cyclic nature where a person may go through many iterations of stimuli, perception, recognition, and action before the final image is identified and understood. When perception occurs, we first experience the preattentive stage in which we observe color, shape, size, and other basic information about the stimuli being perceived. Preattentive perception effects are automatically processed within the first 500 millisectonds of viewing and do not depend on sustained cognitive attention (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020). Following the preattentive stage, direct attention is required for additional processing to allow us to draw connections between components that assist in our interpretation of the stimuli. When viewing a chart or graph, most insights we gain are due to the cognitive processes that occur after attention is focused on specific aspects of the graph. The knowledge a viewer brings to the situation influences their cognitive evaluation of the stimuli. The relationship between physiology and perception can provide us information about how graphics may be understood and interpreted. According to a cognitive analysis, graph interpretation involves (a) relatively simple pattern perception and association processes in which viewers can associate graphic patterns to quantitative referents and (b) more complex and error-prone inferential processes in which viewers must mentally transform data (Shah, Mayer, &amp; Hegarty, 1999). Pyschophysics, the branch of psychology that deals with the relationships between physical stimuli (e.g. light) and mental phenomena, aims to provide explanations of this relationship and point out human perceptual biases. By examining both behavior and physiology together, we are able to understand the mechanisms responsible for perception. 1.4 Graphical Experiments One way in which we determine the relationship between behavior and physiology is through the use of graphical tests. These tests may take many forms: identifying differences in graphs, reading information off of a chart accurately, using data to make correct real-world decisions, or predicting the next few observations. All of these types of tests require different levels of use and manipulation of the information presented in the chart. The initial push to develop classification and recommendation systems for charts was grounded on heuristics rather than on experimentation (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020). Request were made for the validation of the perception and utility of statistical charts through graphical experiments. Initial experiments struggled with methodological issues (Croxton &amp; Stein, 1932; Croxton &amp; Stryker, 1927; Eells, 1926) with most early experimentation stemming from psychophysics research on the perception of size and shape (Teghtsoonian, 1965). While a typical psychophysics experiment focuses on whether an effect is detectable and whether the magnitude of the effect can be accurately estimated, these early experiments instead depended on speed and accuracy for plot evaluation (Lewandowsky &amp; Spence, 1989; Spence, 1990; Teghtsoonian, 1965). Cognitive psychologists and statisticians made progress by conducting experiments to identify perceptual errors associated with different styles of graphics and charts (Cleveland &amp; McGill, 1985; Spence, 1990). These later experiments relied on similar methodology as early studies by relying on participants directly reading information from the charts to provide a quantitative estimate or answering a predefined question; as with the early studies, accuracy and response time being evaluated (Amer, 2005; Broersma &amp; Molenaar, 1985; Cleveland &amp; McGill, 1984; Dunn, 1988; Peterson &amp; Schramm, 1954; Tan, 1994). Cleveland &amp; McGill (1984) provide a basis for perceptual judgment, still utilized today, by examining six basic stimuli: position along a common scale, position along nonaligned scales, length, angle, slope, and area. Other experiments established the notion that redesigning graphs can result in the improvement of the viewers interpretation (Shah, Mayer, &amp; Hegarty, 1999). This is done by relying on gestalt principles to minimize the inferential processes and maximize the pattern association processes required to interpret relevant information. The viewer must first encode the visual array by identifying meaningful visual features, such as a straight light slanting downward. Next, the viewer must classify the quantitative measures and relationships in which those visual features illustrate, such as a decreasing linear relationship between x and y. The last step involves translating the quantitative measures and relationships to the variables defined in the data set, such as a population decreasing over years. These studies establish the process in which viewers interact with charts by first perceptually observing the visual features and later translating to cognitive processing of the information depicted by those features (Shah &amp; Carpenter, 1995). In recent years, there have been advancements in the methodology used to investigate the effectiveness of statistical charts (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020). Some of the new methods, such as the lineup protocol (Buja et al., 2009), utilize the grammar of graphics designation of a data plot as a statistic through the functional mapping of variable(s). This allows the data plot to be tested similar to other statistics, by comparing the actual data plot to a set of plots with the absence of any data structure we can test the likelihood of any perceived structure being significant (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020). While the methodology of these recent experiments differs from earlier studies, the focus is still on initial perception and graph comprehension with a relatively small amount of work conducted to understand the effect of design choices on higher cognitive processes such as learning or analysis (Green &amp; Fisher, 2009). Most recent graphics experiments have utilized tools such as Amazon Turk, Prolific, Reddit, and other crowd sourcing websites to evaluate the psychophysics and patterns associated with design choices (VanderPlas &amp; Hofmann, 2017). Such studies tend to be limited by the questions asked while other methods such as Thinking aloud and Eye Tracking allow researchers to evaluate the overall perception of the graphic (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020). 1.5 Logarithmic Scales and Mapping We have recently experienced the impact graphics and charts have on a large scale through the SARSNCOV-2 pandemic (COVID-19). At the beginning of 2020, we saw an influx of dashboards being developed to display case counts, transmission rates, and outbreak regions (GmbH, 2020); mass media routinely showed charts to share information with the public about the progression of the pandemic (Romano, Sotis, Dominioni, &amp; Guidi, 2020). People began seeking out graphical displays of COVID-19 data as a direct result of these pieces of work (GmbH, 2020); providing increased and ongoing exposure to these graphics over time. Many of these graphics helped guide decision makers to implement policies such as shut-downs or mandated mask wearing, as well as facilitated communication with the public to increase compliance (Bavel et al., 2020). As graphics began to play an important role in the communication of the pandemic, creators of graphics were faced with design choices in order to ensure their charts were effective. When faced with data which spans several orders of magnitude, we must decide whether to show the data on its original scale (compressing the smaller magnitudes into relatively little area) or to transform the scale and alter the contextual appearance of the data. One common solution is to use a log scale transformation to display data over several orders of magnitude within one graph. Logarithms turn multiplicative relationships additive, showing elasticities and other proportional changes, and also linearize power laws (Menge et al., 2018). They also have practical purposes, easing the computation of small numbers such as likelihoods and transforming data to fit statistical assumptions. When presenting log scaled data, it is possible to use either un-transformed scale labels (for example, values of 1, 10 and 100 are equally spaced along the axis) or log transformed scale labels (for example, 0, 1, and 2, showing the corresponding powers of 10). We have recently experienced the benefits and pitfalls of using log scales as COVID-19 dashboards displayed case count data on both the log and linear scale (Burn-Murdoch et al., 2020; Fagen-Ulmschneider, 2020). In spring 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were large magnitude discrepancies in case counts at a given time point between different geographic regions (e.g. states and provinces as well as countries and continents). During this time, we saw the usefulness of log scale transformations showing case count curves for areas with few cases and areas with many cases within one chart. As the pandemic evolved, and the case counts were no longer spreading exponentially, graphs with linear scales seemed more effective at spotting early increases in case counts that signaled more localized outbreaks. This is only one recent example of a situation in which both log and linear scales are useful for showing different aspects of the same data. There are long histories of using log scales to display results in ecology, psychophysics, engineering, and physics (Heckler, Mikula, &amp; Rosenblatt, 2013; Menge et al., 2018) . The usefulness of the log scale in science is exemplified in (Munroe, 2005). Figure 1.6: Log scale comic Research suggests our perception and mapping of numbers to a number line is logarithmic at first, but transitions to a linear scale later in development, with formal mathematics education (Dehaene, Izard, Spelke, &amp; Pica, 2008; Siegler &amp; Braithwaite, 2017, 2017; Varshney &amp; Sun, 2013). For example, a kindergartner asked to place numbers 1-10 along a number line would place 3 close to the middle, following the logarithmic perspective (Varshney &amp; Sun, 2013). With basic training, members of remote cultures with a basic vocabulary and minimal education understood the concept that numbers can be mapped into a spacial space (Dehaene, Izard, Spelke, &amp; Pica, 2008). There was a gradual transition from logarithmic to linear scale as the mapping of whole number magnitude representations transitioned from a compressed (approximately logarithmic) distribution to an approximately linear one. These results indicate the universal and cultural-dependent characteristics of the sense of number. This phenomenon was first discovered by Ernst Weber, an early psychophysics researcher, by determining the relationship between the difference threshold (smallest detectable difference between two sensory stimuli; known as the Just Noticable Difference) and the magnitude of a stimulus. This holds true for a variety of stimuli such as weight, light, and sound as well as for a range of magnitudes; larger numbers require a proportional larger difference in order to remain equally discriminate (Dehaene, Izard, Spelke, &amp; Pica, 2008). Known as Webers law, it was established that we do not notice absolute changes in stimuli, but instead that we notice the relative change (Sun, Wang, Goyal, &amp; Varshney, 2012). Numerically, Webers Law is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\Delta S}{S} = K \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta S\\) represents the difference threshold, S represents the initial stimulus intensity, and K is called Webers contrast which remains constant as the magnitude of S changes. Gustav Fechner, a founder of psychophysics, provided further extension to Webers law by discovering the relationship between the perceived intensity is logarithmic to the stimulus intensity when observed above a minimal threshold of perception (Sun, Wang, Goyal, &amp; Varshney, 2012). Formally known as the Weber-Fechner law is derived from Webers law as \\[\\begin{equation} P = K\\ln \\frac{S}{S_0} \\end{equation}\\] where P represents the perceived stimulus, K represents Webers contrast, S represents the initial stimulus intensity, and \\(S_0\\) represents the minimal threshold of perception. Assuming there is a direct relationship between perceptual and cognitive processes, it is reasonable to assume numerical representations should also be displayed on a nonlinear, compressed number scale. Therefore, if we perceive logarithmically by default, it is a natural (and presumably low effort) way to display information and should be easy to read and understand/use. The idea is compression enlarges the coding space, thus increasing the dynamic range of perception and firing neurons within our visual system (Nieder &amp; Miller, 2003). Similar to the training and education required to transition from logarithmic mapping to linear mapping, there is also necessary training required in the assessment of graphical displays associated with logarithmic scales. Haemer &amp; Kelley (1949) identify semi-logarithmic charts for temporal series as requiring a certain degree of technical training. 1.6 Underestimation of Exponential Growth Figure 1.7: Stages of exponential growth CITE Figure 1.8: Log scale comic Early studies explored the estimation and prediction of exponential growth, finding that growth is underestimated when presented both numerically and graphically but that numerical estimation is more accurate than graphical estimation for exponential curves (Wagenaar &amp; Sagaria, 1975). One way to improve estimation of increasing exponential trends is to provide immediate feedback to participants about the accuracy of their current predictions (Mackinnon &amp; Wearing, 1991). While prior contextual knowledge or experience with exponential growth does not improve estimation, instruction on exponential growth reduces the underestimation: participants adjust their initial starting value but not their perception of growth rate (Jones, 1977; Wagenaar &amp; Sagaria, 1975). Our inability to accurately predict exponential growth might also be addressed by log transforming the data, however, this transformation introduces new complexities; most readers are not mathematically sophisticated enough to intuitively understand logarithmic math and translate that back into real-world effects. In Menge et al. (2018), ecologists were surveyed to determine how often ecologists encounter log scaled data and how well ecologists understand log scaled data when they see it in the literature. Participants were presented two relationships displayed on linear-linear scales, log-log scales with untransformed values, or loglog scales with log transformed values. The authors propose three types of misconceptions participants encountered when presented data on log-log scales: hand-hold fallacy, Zenos zero fallacy, and watch out for curves fallacies. These misconceptions are a result of linear extrapolation assuming that a line in log-log space represents a line instead of the power law in linear-linear space. The study found that in each of these scenarios, participants were confident in their incorrect responses, indicating incorrect knowledge rather than a lack of knowledge. The hand-hold fallacy stems from the misconception that steeper slopes in log-log relationships are steeper slopes in linear-linear space. In fact, it is not only the slope that matters, but also the intercept and the location on the horizontal axis since a line in log-log space represents a power law in linear-linear space (i.e. linear extrapolation). Emerging from Zenos zero fallacy is the misconception that positively sloped lines in log-log space can imply a non-zero value of y when x is zero. This is never true as positively sloped lines in log-log space actually imply that y = 0 when x = 0. This misconception again is a result of linear extrapolation assuming that a line in log-log space represents a line instead of the power law in linear-linear space. The last misconception, watch out for curves fallacies encompasses three faults: (1) lines in log-log space are lines in linear-linear space, (2) lines in log-log space curve upward in linear-linear space, and (3) curves in log-log space have the same curvature in linear-linear space. Linear extrapolation is again responsible for the first and third faults while the second fault is a result of error in thinking that log-log lines represent power laws (which are exponential relationships), and all exponential relationships curve upward; this is only true when the log-log slope is greater than 1. Menge et al. (2018) found that in each of these scenarios, participants were confident in their incorrect responses, indicating incorrect knowledge rather than a lack of knowledge. 1.7 Research Objectives In my research, I conduct three graphical experimental tasks to evaluate the impact our choice of scale (log/linear) has on human perception of exponentially increasing trends. The first experiment evaluates whether our ability to perceptually notice differences in exponentially increasing trends is impacted by the choice of scale. I conducted a visual inference experiment in which participants were shown a series of lineup plots and asked to identify the panel that was most different from the others. The other experimental tasks focus on determining whether there are cognitive disadvantages to log scales: do log scales make it harder to make use of graphical information? I conducted a graphical task similar to the New York Times You Draw It page to test an individuals ability to use and make predictions for exponentially increasing data. Participants were asked to draw a line using their computer mouse through the increasing exponential trend shown on both scales. In addition to differentiation and prediction of exponentially increasing data, an experimental task was conducted to test an individuals ability to translate a graph of exponentially increasing data into real value quantities and extend their estimations by making comparisons. The results of the three experimental tasks provide guidelines for readers to actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw, according to some set of design choices, to ensure that their charts are effective. "],["2-lineups.html", "CHAPTER 2 Perception through lineups 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Data Generation 2.3 Parameter Selection 2.4 Lineup Setup 2.5 Study Design 2.6 Results 2.7 Discussion and Conclusion", " CHAPTER 2 Perception through lineups 2.1 Introduction Previously, we saw how a data plot can be evaluated and treated as a visual statistic, a numerical function which summarizes the data. To evaluate a graph, we have to run our statistic through a visual evaluation - a person. If two different methods of presenting data result in qualitatively different results when evaluated visually, then we can conclude that the visual statistics are significantly different. Recent graphical experiments have utilized statistical lineups to quantify the perception of graphical design choices (Hofmann, Follett, Majumder, &amp; Cook, 2012; Loy, Follett, &amp; Hofmann, 2016; Loy, Hofmann, &amp; Cook, 2017; VanderPlas &amp; Hofmann, 2017). Statistical lineups provide an elegant way of combining perception and statistical hypothesis testing using graphical experiments (Majumder, Hofmann, &amp; Cook, 2013; Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020; H. Wickham, Cook, Hofmann, &amp; Buja, 2010). Lineups are named after the police lineup of criminal investigations where witnesses are asked to identify the criminal from a set of individuals. Similarly, a statistical lineup is a plot consisting of smaller panels; the viewer is asked to identify the plot of the real data from among a set of decoy null plots. Null plots display data under the assumption there is no relationship and can be generated by permutation or simulation. A statistical lineup typically consists of 20 panels - 1 target panel and 19 null panels. If the viewer can identify the target panel embedded within the set of null panels, this suggests that the real data is visually distinct from data generated under the null model. provides examples of a statistical lineups. The lineup plot on the left displays increasing exponential data on a linear scale with panel (2 x 5) + 3 as the target. The lineup plot on the right displays increasing exponential data on the log scale with panel 2 x 2 as the target. Crowd sourcing websites such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Reddit, and Prolifc allow us to collect responses from multiple viewers. Figure 2.1: Lineup example While explicit graphical tests direct the participant to a specific feature of a plot to answer a specific question, implicit graphical tests require the user to identify both the purpose and function of the plot in order to evaluate the plots shown (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020). Implicit graphical tests, such as lineups, have the advantage of simultaneously visually testing for multiple visual features including outliers, clusters, linear and nonlinear relationships. To lay a foundation for future exploration of the use of log scales, we begin with the most fundamental ability to identify differences in charts; this does not require that participants understand exponential growth, identify log scales, or have any mathematical training. Instead, we are simply testing the change in perceptual sensitivity resulting from visualization choices. The study in this chapter is conducted through visual inference and the use of statistical lineups to differentiate between exponentially increasing curves with differing levels of curvature, using linear and log scales. 2.2 Data Generation In this study, both the target and null data sets were generated by simulating data from an exponential model; the models differ in the parameters selected for the null and target panels. In order to guarantee the simulated data spans the same domain and range of values, we implemented a domain constraint of \\(x\\in [0,20]\\) and a range constraint of \\(y\\in [10,100]\\) with \\(N = 50\\) points randomly assigned throughout the domain and mapped to the y-axis using the exponential model with the selected parameters. These constraints provide some assurance that participants who select the target plot are doing so because of their visual perception differentiating between curvature or growth rate rather than different starting or ending values. Data was simulated based on a three-parameter exponential model with multiplicative errors: \\[\\begin{align} y_i &amp; = \\alpha\\cdot e^{\\beta\\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i} + \\theta \\\\ \\text{with } \\epsilon_i &amp; \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2). \\nonumber \\end{align}\\] The parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\) are adjusted based on \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) to guarantee the range and domain constraints are met. The model generated \\(N = 50\\) points \\((x_i, y_i), i = 1,...,N\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have an increasing exponential relationship. The heuristic data generation procedure is described below: 2.3 Parameter Selection For each level of difficulty, we simulated 1000 data sets of \\((x_{ij}, y_{ij})\\) points for \\(i = 1,...,50\\) and \\(j = 1...10\\). Each generated \\(x_i\\) point from was replicated 10 times. Then the lack of fit statistic (LOF) was computed for each simulated data set by calculating the deviation of the data from a linear line. Plotting the density curves of the LOF statistics for each level of difficulty choice allows us to evaluate the ability of differentiating between the difficulty levels and thus detecting the target plot. In , we can see the densities of each of the three difficulty levels. While the LOF statistic provides us a numerical value for discriminating between the difficulty levels, we cannot directly relate this to the perceptual discriminability; it serves primarily as an approximation to ensure that we are testing parameters at several distinct levels of difficulty. Final parameter estimates are shown in . Figure 2.2: Lack of fit statistic density curves 2.4 Lineup Setup Lineup plots were generated by mapping one simulated data set corresponding to difficulty level A to a scatter plot to be identified as the target panel while multiple simulated data sets corresponding to difficulty level B were individually mapped to scatter plots for the null panels. For example, a target plot with simulated data following an increasing exponential curve with high curvature is embedded within null plots with simulated data following an increasing exponential trend with low curvature. By our constraints, the target panel and null panels will span a similar domain and range. There are a total of 6 (i.e. \\(3!\\cdot 2!\\)) lineup curvature combinations. illustrates the 6 lineup curvature combinations where the green line indicates the curvature designated to the target panel while the black line indicates the curvature assigned to the null panels. Two sets of each lineup curvature combination were simulated (total of 12 test data sets) and plotted on both the linear scale and the log scale (total of 24 test lineup plots). In addition, there are three curvature combinations which generate homogeneous Rorschach lineups, where all panels are from the same distribution. Each participant evaluated one of these lineups, but for simplicity, these evaluations are not described in this chapter. Figure 2.3: Lineup curvature combinations 2.5 Study Design Each participant was shown a total of thirteen lineup plots (12 test lineup plots and 1 Rorschach lineup plot). Participants were randomly assigned one of the two replicate data sets for each of the 6 unique lineup curvature combinations. For each assigned test data set, the participant was shown the lineup plot corresponding to both the linear scale and the log scale. For the additional Rorschach lineup plot, participants were randomly assigned one data set shown on either the linear or the log scale. The order of the thirteen lineup plots shown was randomized for each participant. Participants above the age of majority were recruited from Reddits Visualization and Sample Size communities. Since participants recruited on Reddit were not compensated for their time, most participants have an interest in data visualization research. Previous literature suggests that prior mathematical knowledge or experience with exponential data is not associated with the outcome of graphical experiments (VanderPlas &amp; Hofmann, 2015). Participants completed the experiment using a Shiny application found here. Participants were shown a series of lineup plots and asked to identify the plot that was most different from the others. On each plot, participants were asked to justify their choice and provide their level of confidence in their choice. The goal of this experimental task is to test an individuals ability to perceptually differentiate exponentially increasing trends with differing levels of curvature on both the linear and log scale. 2.6 Results Participant recruitment through Reddit occurred over the course of two weeks during which 58 individuals completed 518 unique test lineup evaluations. Previous studies have found that results do not differ on lineup-related tasks between Reddit and e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk (VanderPlas &amp; Hofmann, 2017). Participants who completed fewer than 6 lineup evaluations were removed from the study (17 participants, 41 evaluations). The final data set included a total of 41 participants and 477 lineup evaluations. Each plot was evaluated by between 18 and 28 individuals (Mean: 21.77, SD: 2.29). In 67% of the 477 lineup evaluations, participants correctly identified the target panel. Target plot identification was analyzed using the glmer function in the lme4 R package (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015). Estimates and odds ratio comparisons between the log and linear scales were calculated using the emmeans R package (Lenth, 2021). Each lineup plot evaluated was assigned a value based on the participant response (correct = 1, not correct = 0). Define \\(Y_{ijkl}\\) to be the event that participant \\(l = 1,...,N_{participant}\\) correctly identifies the target plot for data set \\(k = 1,2\\) with curvature combination \\(j = 1,2,3,4,5,6\\) plotted on scale \\(i = 1,2\\). The binary response was analyzed using generalized linear mixed model following a binomial distribution with a logit link function following a row-column blocking design accounting for the variation due to participant and data set respectively as \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{logit }P(Y_{ijk}) = \\eta + \\delta_i + \\gamma_j + \\delta \\gamma_{ij} + s_l + d_k \\end{equation}\\] where We assume that random effects for data set and participant are independent. The analysis of variance table shown in indicates a significant interaction between the curvature combination and scale. Variance due to participant and data set were estimated to be \\(\\sigma^2_{\\text{participant}} = 2.79\\) (s.e. 1.67) and \\(\\sigma^2_{\\text{data}} = 0.44\\) (s.e. 0.66) respectively. On both the log and linear scales, the highest accuracy occurred in lineup plots where the target model and null model had large curvature differences (i.e. high curvature target panel embedded in low curvature null panels; low curvature target panel embedded in high curvature null panels). There is a decrease in accuracy on the linear scale when comparing a target plot with less curvature to null plots with more curvature (i.e. medium curvature target panel embedded in high curvature null panels; low curvature target panel embedded in medium curvature null panels). Best, Smith, &amp; Stubbs (2007) found that accuracy of identifying the correct curve type was higher when nonlinear trends were presented indicating that it is hard to say something is linear (i.e. something has less curvature), but easy to say that it is not linear; our results concur with this observation. Overall, there are no significant differences in accuracy between curvature combinations when data is presented on a log scale indicating participants were consistent in their success of identifying the target panel on the log scale. displays the estimated (log) odds ratio of successfully identifying the target panel on the log scale compared to the linear scale. The choice of scale has no impact if curvature differences are large (i.e. low curvature and high curvature combinations). However, presenting data on the log scale makes us more sensitive to slight changes in curvature (i.e. high curvature target panel embedded in medium curvature null panels; medium curvature target panel embedded in high curvature null panels; low curvature target panel embedded in medium curvature null panels). An exception occurs when identifying a plot with curvature embedded in null plots close to a linear trend (i.e. medum curvature target panel embedded in low curvature null panels), again supporting the claim that it is easy to identify a curve in a bunch of lines but much harder to identify a line in a bunch of curves (Best, Smith, &amp; Stubbs, 2007). Figure 2.4: Lineups log(odds) results 2.7 Discussion and Conclusion The overall goal of this chapter is to provide basic research to support the principles used to guide design decisions in scientific visualizations of exponential data. In this study, we explore the use of linear and log scales to determine whether our ability to notice differences in exponentially increasing trends is impacted by the choice of scale. Our results indicated that when there was a large difference in curvature between the target plot and null plots, the choice of scale had no impact and participants accurately differentiated between the two curves on both the linear and log scale. However, displaying exponentially increasing data on a log scale improved the accuracy of differentiating between models with slight curvature differences. An exception occurred when identifying a plot with curvature embedded in surrounding plots closely relating to a linear trend, indicating that it is easy to identify a curve in a group of lines but much harder to identify a line in a group of curves. The use of visual inference to identify these guidelines suggests that there are advantages to log scales when differences are subtle. What remains to be seen is whether there are cognitive disadvantages to log scales: do log scales make it harder to make use of graphical information? "],["3-youdrawit.html", "CHAPTER 3 Prediction with you draw it 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Study Design 3.3 Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era 3.4 Prediction of Exponential Trends 3.5 Discussion and Conclusion", " CHAPTER 3 Prediction with you draw it 3.1 Introduction In Chapter 2, a base foundation for future exploration of the use of log scales was established by evaluating participants ability to identify differences in charts through the use of lineups. This did not require that participants were able to understand exponential growth, identify log scales, or have any mathematical training; instead, it simply tested the change in perceptual sensitivity resulting from visualization choices. In order to determine whether there are cognitive disadvantages to log scales, we utilize interactive graphics to test an individuals ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data. In this study, participants are asked to draw a line using their computer mouse through the exponentially increasing trend shown on both the log and linear scale. 3.1.1 Past Methodology Initial studies in the 20th century explored the use of fitting lines by eye through a set of points (Finney, 1951; Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz, 1981). Common methods of fitting trends by eye involve maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit is suitable, then drawing the line. In Finney (1951), it was of interest to determine the effect of stopping iterative maximum likelihood calculations after one iteration. Twenty-one scientists were recruited via postal mail and asked to rule two lines in order to judge by eye the positions for a pair of parallel probit regression lines in a biological assay . Results indicated that one cycle of iterations was sufficient based on the starting values provided by eye from the participants. Figure 3.1: Subjective Judgement in Statistical Analysis (1951) Parallel Probits Thirty years later, Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981), sought to understand the properties of least squares and other computed lines by establishing one systematic method of fitting lines by eye. The authors recruited 153 graduate students and post doctoral researchers in Introductory Biostatistics. Participants were asked to fit lines by eye to four sets of points using an 8.5 x 11 inch transparency with a straight line etched completely across the middle. A latin square design with packets of the set of points stapled together in four different sequences was used to determine if there is an effect of order of presentation. It was found that order of presentation had no effect and that participants tended to fit the slope of the first principal component over the slope of the least squares regression line. Figure 3.2: Eye Fitting Straight Lines (1981) Data Sets In 2015, the New York Times introduced an interactive feature, called You Draw It (Aisch, Cox, &amp; Quealy, 2015; Buchanan, Park, &amp; Pearce, 2017; Katz, 2017) Readers are asked to input their own assumptions about various metrics and compare how these assumptions relate to reality. The NY Times team utilizes Data Driven Documents (D3) that allows readers to predict these metrics through the use of drawing a line on their computer screen with their computer mouse. is one such example in which readers are asked to draw the line for the missing years providing what they estimate to be the number of Americans who have died every year from car accidents, since 1990. After the reader has completed drawing the line, the actual observed values are revealed and the reader may check their estimated knowledge against the actual reported data (Katz, 2017). Figure 3.3: New York Times You Draw It Feature 3.1.2 Data Driven Documents Major news and research organizations such as the NY Times, FiveThirtyEight, Washing Post, and the Pew Research Center create and customize graphics with Data Driven Documents (D3). In June 2020, the NY Times released a front page displaying figures that represent each of the 100,000 lives lost from the coronavirus pandemic until this point in time (Barry et al., 2020); this visualization was meant to bring about a visceral reaction and resonate with readers. During 2021 March Maddness, FiveThirtyEight created a roster-shuffling machine which allowed readers to build their own NBA contender through interactivity (Ryanabest, 2021). Data Driven Documents (D3) is an open-source JavaScript based graphing framework created by Mike Bostock during his time working on graphics at the NY Times. For readers familiar with R, it is notable to consider D3 in JavaScript equivalent to the ggplot2 package in R. Similar to geometric objects and style choices in ggplot2, the grammar of D3 also includes elements such as circles, paths, and rectangles with choices of attributes and styles such as color and size. Data Driven Documents depend on Extensible Markup Langage (XML) to generate graphics and images by binding objects and layers to the plotting area as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in order to preserve the shapes rather than the pixels . Advantages of using D3 include animation and allowing for movement and user interaction such as hovering, clicking, and brushing. Figure 3.4: SVG vs Raster A challenge of working with D3 is the environment necessary to display the graphics and images. The r2d3 package in R provides an efficient integration of D3 visuals and R by displaying them in familiar HTML output formats such as RMarkdown or Shiny applications (Luraschi &amp; Allaire, 2018). The creator of the graphic applies D3.js source code to visualize data which has previously been processed within an R setting. The example R code illustrates the structure of the r2d3 function which includes specification of a data frame in R (converted to a JSON file), the D3.js source code file, and the D3 version that accompanies the source code. A default SVG container for layering elements is then generated by the r2d3 function which renders the plot using the source code. Appendix A outlines the development of the you draw interactive plots used in this study through the use of r2d3 and R shiny applications. provides an example of a you draw it interactive plot as seen by participants during the study. The first frame shows what the participant sees along with the prompt, Use your mouse to fill in the trend in the yellow box region. Next, the yellow box region moves along as the participant draws their trend-line until the yellow region disappears indicating the participant has filled in the entire domain. r2d3(data = data, script = &quot;d3-source-code.js&quot;, d3_version = &quot;5&quot;) Figure 3.5: You Draw It Example 3.2 Study Design This chapter contains two sub-studies; the first aims to establish you draw it as a tool for measuring predictions of trends fitted by eye and the second then applies you draw it as a method for testing graphics. Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981) was replicated as part of the study data collection in order to validate you draw it as a method for testing graphics, referred to as Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era. This method is then used to test an individuals ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data on both the log and linear scales, referred to as Prediction of Exponential Trends. Data for both sub-studies were collected in conjunction with one another over the same study participant sample. A total of 6 data sets - 4 Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era and 2 Prediction of Exponential Trends - are generated for each individual at the start of the experiment. The 2 simulated data sets corresponding to the simulated data models used in the Prediction of Exponential Trends sub-study are then plotted a total of 4 times each with different aesthetic and scale choices for a total of 8 task plots. Participants in the study are first shown 2 you draw it practice plots followed by 12 you draw it task plots. The order of all 12 task plots was randomly assigned for each individual in a completely randomized design where users saw the 4 task plots from the Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era sub-study interspersed with the 8 task plots from the Prediction of Exponential Trends sub-study. Participants completed the experiment using a RShiny application found here. Participants were recruited through Twitter, Reddit, and direct email during May 2021. A total of individuals completed unique you draw it task plots. All completed you draw it task plots were included in the analysis. 3.3 Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era Finney (1951) and Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981) use methods such as using a ruler, string, or transparency sheet to fit straight lines through a set of points. This section replicates the study found in Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981) in order to establish you draw it as a tool and method for testing graphics. 3.3.1 Data Generation All data processing was conducted in R before being passed to the D3.js source code. A total of \\(N = 30\\) points \\((x_i, y_i), i = 1,...N\\) were generated for \\(x\\in [x_{min}, x_{max}]\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have a linear relationship. Data was simulated based on linear model with additive errors: \\[\\begin{align} y_i &amp; = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + e_i \\\\ \\text{with } e_i &amp; \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2). \\nonumber \\end{align}\\] The parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are selected to replicate Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981) with \\(e_i\\) generated by rejection sampling in order to guarantee the points shown align with that of the fitted line. An ordinary least squares regression is then fit to the simulated points in order to obtain the best fit line and fitted values in 0.25 increments across the domain, \\((x_k, \\hat y_{k,OLS}), k = 1, ..., 4\\cdot x_{max} +1\\). The data simulation function then outputs a list of point data and line data both indicating the parameter identification, x value, and corresponding simulated or fitted y value. The data simulation procedure is described in . Simulated model equation parameters were selected to reflect the four data sets (F, N, S, and V) used in Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981) . Parameter choices F, N, and S simulated data across a domain of 0 to 20. Parameter choice F produces a trend with a positive slope and a large variance while N has a negative slope and a large variance. In comparison, S shows a trend with a postive slope with a small variance and V yields a steep positive slope with a small variance over the domain of 4 to 16. illustrates an example of simulated data for all four parameter choices intended to reflect the trends seen in . Within the interactive plot code, the aspect ratio defining the x to y axis ratio was set to 1 with a consistent y range buffer of 10% to allow for users to draw outside the data set range. Figure 3.6: Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era Simulated Data Example 3.3.2 Results In addition to the participant drawn points, \\((x_k, y_{drawn})\\), and the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression fitted values, \\((x_k, \\hat y_{k,OLS})\\), a regression equation with a slope based on the first principal component (PCA) was used to calculate fitted values, \\((x_k, \\hat y_{k,PCA})\\). For each set of simulated data and parameter combination, the PCA regression equation was determined by using the princomp function in the base R stats package to obtain the rotations of the first principal component for vectors x and y. The estimated slope, \\(\\hat\\beta_{1,PCA}\\), is determined by the ratio of the y rotation and x rotation of the first principal component with the y-intercept, \\(\\hat\\beta_{0,PCA}\\) calculated by the point-slope equation of a line using the mean of of the simulated points, \\((\\bar x_i, \\bar y_i)\\). Fitted values, \\(\\hat y_{k,PCA}\\) are then obtained every 0.25 increment across the domain from the PCA regression equation, \\(\\hat y_{k,PCA} = \\hat\\beta_{0,PCA} + \\hat\\beta_{1,PCA} x_k\\). illustrates the difference between an OLS regression equation which minimizes the vertical distance of points from the line and a regression equation with a slope calculated by the first principal component which minimizes the smallest distance of points from the line. Figure 3.7: OLS vs PCA Regression Lines For each participant, the final data set used for analysis contains \\(x_{ijk}, y_{ijk,drawn}, \\hat y_{ijk,OLS}\\), and \\(\\hat y_{ijk,PCA}\\) for parameter choice \\(i = 1,2,3,4\\), j = \\(1,...N_{participant}\\), and \\(x_{k}\\) value \\(k = 1, ...,4\\cdot x_{max} + 1\\). Using both a linear mixed model and a generalized additive mixed model, comparisons of vertical residuals in relation to the OLS fitted values (\\(e_{k,OLS} = y_{k,drawn} - \\hat y_{k,OLS}\\)) and PCA fitted values (\\(e_{k,PCA} = y_{k,drawn} - \\hat y_{k,PCA}\\)) were made across the domain of x. displays an example of all three fitted trend lines for parameter choice F. Figure 3.8: Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era Example Using the lmer function in the lme4 package (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015), a linear mixed model (LMM) is fit separately to the OLS and PCA residuals, constraining the fit to a linear trend. Parameter choice, \\(x\\), and the interaction between \\(x\\) and parameter choice were treated as fixed effects with a random participant effect accounting for variation due to participant. The LMM equation for each fit (OLS and PCA) residuals is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ijk,drawn} - y_{ijk,fit} = e_{ijk,fit} = \\left[\\gamma_0 + \\alpha_i\\right] + \\left[\\gamma_{1} x_{ijk} + \\gamma_{2i} x_{ijk}\\right] + p_{j} + \\epsilon_{ijk} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\gamma_0\\) is the overall intercept \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the effect of the parameter choice on the intercept \\(\\gamma_1\\) is the overall slope for \\(x\\) \\(\\gamma_{2i}\\) is the effect of the parameter choice on the slope \\(p_{j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{participant})\\) is the random error due to participant variation \\(\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) is the residual error. Eliminating the linear trend constraint, the bam function in the mgcv package (S. N. Wood, 2003, 2004, 2011; S. N. Wood, 2017; S. N. Wood, N., Pya, &amp; Saefken, 2016) is used to fit a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) separately to the OLS and PCA residuals to allow for estimation of smoothing splines. Parameter choice was treated as a fixed effect with no estimated intercept and a separate smoothing spline for \\(x\\) was estimated for each parameter choice. A random participant effect accounting for variation due to participant and a random spline for each participant accounted for variation in spline for each participant. The GAMM equation for each fit (OLS and PCA) residuals is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ijk, drawn} - y_{ijk, fit} = e_{ijk,fit} = \\alpha_i + s_{i}(x_{ijk}) + p_{j} + s_{j}(x_{ijk}) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the intercept for the parameter choice \\(i\\) \\(s_{i}\\) is the smoothing spline for the \\(i^{th}\\) parameter combination \\(p_{j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{participant})\\) is the error due to participant variation \\(s_{j}\\) is the random smoothing spline for each participant. and show the estimated trends of residuals (vertical deviation of participant drawn points from both the OLS and PCA fitted points) as modeled by a LMM and GAMM respectively. Examining the plots, the estimated trends of PCA residuals (orange) appear to align closer to the \\(y=0\\) horizontal (dashed) line than the OLS residuals (blue). In particular, this trend is more prominent in parameter choices with large variances (F and N). These results are consistent to those found in Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981) indicating participants fit a trend line closer to the estimated regression line with the slope of the first principal component than the estimated OLS regression line. Figure 3.9: Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era LMM results Figure 3.10: Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era GAMM results In addition to fitting trend lines over the residuals between the participant drawn values and fitted values, an OLS sum of squares and PCA sums of squares measure was calculated for each you draw it plot. Sums of squares between fits were compared using lmer (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015) to run a linear mixed model (LMM) with a log transformation. Parameter choice, fit, and the interaction between parameter choice and fit were treated as fixed effects with a random participant effect. Define \\(SS_{ijk}\\) as the sums of squares for parameter choice \\(i = 1,2,3,4\\), fit \\(j=1,2\\), and participant \\(k = 1,...,N_{participant}\\). The LMM equation is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\log\\left(SS_{ijk}\\right) = \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\alpha\\beta_{ij} + p_{j} + \\epsilon_{ij} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\alpha_i\\) denotes the effect of the \\(i^{th}\\) parameter choice \\(\\beta_j\\) denotes the effect of the \\(j^{th}\\) fit \\(\\alpha\\beta_{ij}\\) denotes the interaction between the parameter choice and fit \\(p_{j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{participant})\\) is the random error due to participant variation \\(\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) is the residual error. displays estimated odds ratios between the OLS fit and PCA fit for each parameter choice. While there is no significant effect of fit for any parameter choices, there is indication of the trend found previously in the residual regression models. Figure 3.11: Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era Sum of Squares Results 3.4 Prediction of Exponential Trends The results from the first sub-study validate you draw it as a tool for testing graphics. This sub-study is designed to test an individuals ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data on both the log and linear scales, addressesing cognitive understanding of log scales. Participants are asked to draw a line using their computer mouse through the exponentially increasing trend shown on both the log and linear scale. 3.4.1 Data Generation All data processing was conducted in R before being passed to the D3.js source code. A total of \\(N = 30\\) points \\((x_i, y_i), i = 1,...N\\) were generated for \\(x\\in [x_{min}, x_{max}]\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have an exponential relationship. Data was simulated based on a one parameter exponential model with multiplicative errors: \\[\\begin{align} y_i &amp; = e^{\\beta x + e_i} \\\\ \\text{with } e_i &amp; \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2). \\nonumber \\end{align}\\] The parameter, \\(\\beta\\), was selected to reflect the rate of exponential growth with \\(e_i\\) generated by rejection sampling in order to guarantee the points shown align with that of the fitted line displayed in the initial plot frame. A nonlinear least squares regression is then fit to the simulated points in order to obtain the best fit line and fitted values in 0.25 increments across the domain, \\((x_k, \\hat y_{k,NLS}), k = 1, ..., 4\\cdot x_{max} +1\\). The data simulation function then outputs a list of point data and line data both indicating the parameter identification, x value, and corresponding simulated or fitted y value. The data simulation procedure is described in . Model equation parameter, \\(\\beta\\), was selected to reflect two exponential growth rates (low: \\(\\beta = 0.10, \\sigma = 0.09\\) and high: \\(\\beta = 0.23, \\sigma = 0.25\\)) as determined by visual inspection with growth rate parameter selection from the lineup study in Chapter 2 used as a starting point. Each growth rate parameter was used to simulate data across a domain of 0 to 20. The 2 simulated data sets (low and high exponential growth rates) were then shown 4 times each by truncating the points shown at both 50% and 75% of the domain as well as on both the log and linear scales for a total of 8 interactive plots reflecting a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial treatment design. Appendix B displays visual examples of all 8 interactive plots. Within the interactive plot code, the aspect ratio defining the x to y axis ratio was set to 1 with a y range buffer of 50% on the lower limit and 200% on the upper limit to allow for users to draw outside the data set range. The linear scale option was set to true or false reflecting the linear and log scale display choices respectively with the user line start draw point set to 50% of the domain at \\(x = 10\\). 3.4.2 Results Loess smoothers were fit to each user line to allow for visual inspection. For each participant \\(l = 1,...N_{participant}\\), the final data set used for analysis contains \\(x_{ijkm}, y_{ijkm,drawn}, \\hat y_{ijkm,loess}\\), and \\(\\hat y_{ijkm,NLS}\\) for growth rate \\(i = 1,2\\), points truncated \\(j = 1,2\\), scale \\(k = 1,2\\) and \\(x_{m}\\) value \\(m = 1, ...,81\\). displays spaghetti plots for each of the 8 treatment combinations. The spaghetti plot with a high growth rate suggests participants underestimated the exponential trend when asked to draw a trend line on the linear scale compared to when asked to draw a trend line on the log scale. In particular, this suggestion is most noticable when points are truncated at 50% with the underestimation begining at a later \\(x\\) value when points are truncated at 75%. Figure 3.12: Exponential Prediction Spaghetti Plot Allowing for flexibility, the bam function in the mgcv package (S. N. Wood, 2003, 2004, 2011; S. N. Wood, 2017; S. N. Wood, N., Pya, &amp; Saefken, 2016) is used to fit a GAMM to estimate trends of vertical residuals from the participant drawn line in relation to the NLS fitted values (\\(e_{ijklm,NLS} = y_{ijklm,drawn} - \\hat y_{ijklm,NLS}\\)) across the domain of \\(x\\). The combination between growth rate, point truncation, and scale was treated as a fixed effect with no estimated intercept and a separate smoothing spline for \\(x\\) was estimated for each treatment combination. A random participant effect accounting for variation due to participant and a random spline for each participant accounted for variation in spline for each participant. The GAMM equation for residuals is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ijklm,drawn} - y_{ijklm,NLS} = e_{ijklm,nls} = \\tau_{ijk} + s_{ijk}(x_{ijkm}) + p_{l} + s_{m}(x_{ijklm}) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\tau_{ijk}\\) is the intercept for the \\(i^{th}\\) growth rate, \\(j^{th}\\) point truncation, and \\(k^{th}\\) scale treatment combination \\(s_{ijk}\\) is the smoothing spline for the \\(ijk^{th}\\) treatment combination \\(p_{m} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{participant})\\) is the error due to participant variation \\(s_{m}\\) is the random smoothing spline for each participant. show the estimated trends of residuals (vertical deviation of participant drawn points from NLS fitted points) as modeled by a GAMM. Examining the plots, the estimated trends of residuals of trends drawn on the linear scale (blue) appear to deviate from the \\(y=0\\) horizontal (dashed) line indicating underestimation of exponential growth. In comparisons, the estimated trends of trends residuals drawn on the log scale (orange) follow closely to the \\(y=0\\) horizontal (dashed) line implying exponential trends predicted on the log scale are more accurate than those predicted on the linear scale. In particular, this trend is more prominent in high exponential growth rates where underestimation becomes prominent after the aid of points is removed. Figure 3.13: Exponential Prediction GAMM Results 3.5 Discussion and Conclusion The intent of this chapter was to establish you draw it as a tool for testing graphics then use this tool to determine the cognitive implications of displaying data on the log scale. Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era replicated the results found in Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981). When shown points following a linear trend, participants tended to fit the slope of the first principal component over the slope of the least squares regression line. This trend was most prominent when shown data simulated with larger variances. The reproducibility of these results serve as evidence of the reliability of the you draw it method. In Prediction of Exponential Trends, the you draw it method was used to test an individuals ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data. Results indicate that underestimation of exponential growth occurs when participants were asked to draw trend lines on the linear scale and that there was an improvement in accuracy when trends were drawn on the log scale. This phenomena is strongly supported for high exponential growth rates. Improvement in predictions are made when points along the exponential trend are shown as indicated by the discrepancy in results for treatments with points truncated at 50% compared to 75% of the domain. The results of this study suggest that there are cognitive advantages to log scales when making predictions of exponential trends. Improvement in predictions were made for trends with high exponential growth rates when participants were asked to draw a trend line on the log scale compared to the linear scale. Further investigation is necessary to determine the implications of using log scales when translating exponential graphs to numerical values.
