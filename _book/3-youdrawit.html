<p>In <a href="2-lineups.html#lineups">Chapter 2</a>, a base foundation for future exploration of the use of log scales was established by evaluating participants ability to identify differences in charts through the use of lineups.
This did not require that participants were able to understand exponential growth, identify log scales, or have any mathematical training; instead, it simply tested the change in perceptual sensitivity resulting from visualization choices.
In order to determine whether there are cognitive disadvantages to log scales, we utilize interactive graphics to test an individual’s ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data. In this study, participants are asked to draw a line using their computer mouse through the exponentially increasing trend shown on both the log and linear scale.</p>
<!-- + Early studies explored the estimation and prediction of exponential growth, finding that growth is underestimated when presented both numerically and graphically but that numerical estimation is more accurate than graphical estimation for exponential curves [@wagenaar_misperception_1975].  -->
<div id="past-methodology" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Past Methodology</h3>
<p>Initial studies in the 20th century explored the use of fitting lines by eye through a set of points <span class="citation">(Finney, 1951; Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz, 1981)</span>.
Common methods of fitting trends by eye involve maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit is suitable, then drawing the line.
In <span class="citation">Finney (1951)</span>, it was of interest to determine the effect of stopping iterative maximum likelihood calculations after one iteration. Twenty-one scientists were recruited via postal mail and asked to “rule two lines” in order to judge by eye the positions for a pair of parallel probit regression lines in a biological assay .
Results indicated that one cycle of iterations was sufficient based on the starting values provided by eye from the participants.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, <span class="citation">Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981)</span>, sought to understand the properties of least squares and other computed lines by establishing one systematic method of fitting lines by eye.
The authors recruited 153 graduate students and post doctoral researchers in Introductory Biostatistics.
Participants were asked to fit lines by eye to four sets of points  using an 8.5 x 11 inch transparency with a straight line etched completely across the middle.
A latin square design with packets of the set of points stapled together in four different sequences was used to determine if there is an effect of order of presentation.
It was found that order of presentation had no effect and that participants tended to fit the slope of the first principal component over the slope of the least squares regression line.</p>

<p>In 2015, the New York Times introduced an interactive feature, called You Draw It <span class="citation">(Aisch, Cox, &amp; Quealy, 2015; Buchanan, Park, &amp; Pearce, 2017; Katz, 2017)</span>
Readers are asked to input their own assumptions about various metrics and compare how these assumptions relate to reality.
The NY Times team utilizes Data Driven Documents (D3) that allows readers to predict these metrics through the use of drawing a line on their computer screen with their computer mouse.
 is one such example in which readers are asked to draw the line for the missing years providing what they estimate to be the number of Americans who have died every year from car accidents, since 1990.
After the reader has completed drawing the line, the actual observed values are revealed and the reader may check their estimated knowledge against the actual reported data <span class="citation">(Katz, 2017)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Data Driven Documents</h3>
<p>Major news and research organizations such as the NY Times, FiveThirtyEight, Washing Post, and the Pew Research Center create and customize graphics with Data Driven Documents (D3).
In June 2020, the NY Times released a front page displaying figures that represent each of the 100,000 lives lost from the coronavirus pandemic until this point in time <span class="citation">(Barry et al., 2020)</span>; this visualization was meant to bring about a visceral reaction and resonate with readers.
During 2021 March Maddness, FiveThirtyEight created a roster-shuffling machine which allowed readers to build their own NBA contender through interactivity <span class="citation">(Ryanabest, 2021)</span>.
Data Driven Documents (D3) is an open-source JavaScript based graphing framework created by Mike Bostock during his time working on graphics at the NY Times.
For readers familiar with R, it is notable to consider D3 in JavaScript equivalent to the ggplot2 package in R.
Similar to geometric objects and style choices in ggplot2, the grammar of D3 also includes elements such as circles, paths, and rectangles with choices of attributes and styles such as color and size.
Data Driven Documents depend on Extensible Markup Langage (XML) to generate graphics and images by binding objects and layers to the plotting area as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in order to preserve the shapes rather than the pixels  .
<!-- https://martech.zone/vecteezy-svg-editor-online/ -->
Advantages of using D3 include animation and allowing for movement and user interaction such as hovering, clicking, and brushing.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:raster-vs-vector"></span>
<img src="images/raster-vs-vector.png" alt="SVG vs Raster" width="70%"  />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3.4: SVG vs Raster
</p>
</div>
<p>A challenge of working with D3 is the environment necessary to display the graphics and images.
The r2d3 package in R provides an efficient integration of D3 visuals and R by displaying them in familiar HTML output formats such as RMarkdown or Shiny applications <span class="citation">(Luraschi &amp; Allaire, 2018)</span>.
The creator of the graphic applies D3.js source code to visualize data which has previously been processed within an R setting.</p>
<p>The example R code illustrates the structure of the r2d3 function which includes specification of a data frame in R (converted to a JSON file), the D3.js source code file, and the D3 version that accompanies the source code.
A default SVG container for layering elements is then generated by the r2d3 function which renders the plot using the source code.
<a href="A-youdrawit-with-shiny.html#youdrawit-with-shiny">Appendix A</a> outlines the development of the you draw interactive plots used in this study through the use of r2d3 and R shiny applications.
 provides an example of a you draw it interactive plot as seen by participants during the study.
The first frame shows what the participant sees along with the prompt, “Use your mouse to fill in the trend in the yellow box region.”
Next, the yellow box region moves along as the participant draws their trend-line until the yellow region disappears indicating the participant has filled in the entire domain.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Study Design</h2>
<p>This chapter contains two sub-studies; the first aims to establish you draw it as a tool for measuring predictions of trends fitted by eye and the second then applies you draw it as a method for testing graphics.
<span class="citation">Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981)</span> was replicated as part of the study data collection in order to validate you draw it as a method for testing graphics, referred to as Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era.
This method is then used to test an individual’s ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data on both the log and linear scales, referred to as Prediction of Exponential Trends.
Data for both sub-studies were collected in conjunction with one another over the same study participant sample.</p>
<p>A total of 6 data sets - 4 Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era and 2 Prediction of Exponential Trends - are generated for each individual at the start of the experiment.
The 2 simulated data sets corresponding to the simulated data models used in the Prediction of Exponential Trends sub-study are then plotted a total of 4 times each with different aesthetic and scale choices for a total of 8 task plots.
Participants in the study are first shown 2 you draw it practice plots followed by 12 you draw it task plots.
The order of all 12 task plots was randomly assigned for each individual in a completely randomized design where users saw the 4 task plots from the Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era sub-study interspersed with the 8 task plots from the Prediction of Exponential Trends sub-study.</p>
<p>Participants completed the experiment using a RShiny application found <a href="https://shiny.srvanderplas.com/you-draw-it/">here</a>.
Participants were recruited through Twitter, Reddit, and direct email during May 2021.
A total of  individuals completed  unique you draw it task plots.
All completed you draw it task plots were included in the analysis.</p>

An ordinary least squares regression is then fit to the simulated points in order to obtain the best fit line and fitted values in 0.25 increments across the domain, <span class="math inline">\((x_k, \hat y_{k,OLS}), k = 1, ..., 4\cdot x_{max} +1\)</span>.
The data simulation function then outputs a list of point data and line data both indicating the parameter identification, x value, and corresponding simulated or fitted y value.
The data simulation procedure is described in .</p>
<p>Simulated model equation parameters were selected to reflect the four data sets (F, N, S, and V) used in <span class="citation">Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981)</span> .
Parameter choices F, N, and S simulated data across a domain of 0 to 20.
Parameter choice F produces a trend with a positive slope and a large variance while N has a negative slope and a large variance.
In comparison, S shows a trend with a postive slope with a small variance and V yields a steep positive slope with a small variance over the domain of 4 to 16.

Within the interactive plot code, the aspect ratio defining the x to y axis ratio was set to 1 with a consistent y range buffer of 10% to allow for users to draw outside the data set range.</p>

<p>In addition to the participant drawn points, <span class="math inline">\((x_k, y_{drawn})\)</span>, and the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression fitted values, <span class="math inline">\((x_k, \hat y_{k,OLS})\)</span>, a regression equation with a slope based on the first principal component (PCA) was used to calculate fitted values, <span class="math inline">\((x_k, \hat y_{k,PCA})\)</span>.
For each set of simulated data and parameter combination, the PCA regression equation was determined by using the princomp function in the base R stats package to obtain the rotations of the first principal component for vectors x and y.
The estimated slope, <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_{1,PCA}\)</span>, is determined by the ratio of the y rotation and x rotation of the first principal component with the y-intercept, <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_{0,PCA}\)</span> calculated by the point-slope equation of a line using the mean of of the simulated points, <span class="math inline">\((\bar x_i, \bar y_i)\)</span>.
Fitted values, <span class="math inline">\(\hat y_{k,PCA}\)</span> are then obtained every 0.25 increment across the domain from the PCA regression equation, <span class="math inline">\(\hat y_{k,PCA} = \hat\beta_{0,PCA} + \hat\beta_{1,PCA} x_k\)</span>.

<p>Using the lmer function in the lme4 package <span class="citation">(Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015)</span>, a linear mixed model (LMM) is fit separately to the OLS and PCA residuals, constraining the fit to a linear trend.
Parameter choice, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and the interaction between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and parameter choice were treated as fixed effects with a random participant effect accounting for variation due to participant.
The LMM equation for each fit (OLS and PCA) residuals is given by:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
y_{ijk,drawn} - y_{ijk,fit} = e_{ijk,fit} = \left[\gamma_0 + \alpha_i\right] + \left[\gamma_{1} x_{ijk} + \gamma_{2i} x_{ijk}\right] + p_{j} + \epsilon_{ijk}

<p>Eliminating the linear trend constraint, the bam function in the mgcv package <span class="citation">(S. N. Wood, 2003, 2004, 2011; S. N. Wood, 2017; S. N.

Parameter choice was treated as a fixed effect with no estimated intercept and a separate smoothing spline for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> was estimated for each parameter choice. A random participant effect accounting for variation due to participant and a random spline for each participant accounted for variation in spline for each participant.
The GAMM equation for each fit (OLS and PCA) residuals is given by:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

Examining the plots, the estimated trends of PCA residuals (orange) appear to align closer to the <span class="math inline">\(y=0\)</span> horizontal (dashed) line than the OLS residuals (blue).
In particular, this trend is more prominent in parameter choices with large variances (F and N).
These results are consistent to those found in <span class="citation">Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981)</span> indicating participants fit a trend line closer to the estimated regression line with the slope of the first principal component than the estimated OLS regression line.</p>

<p>In addition to fitting trend lines over the residuals between the participant drawn values and fitted values, an OLS sum of squares and PCA sums of squares measure was calculated for each you draw it plot.

<p>All data processing was conducted in R before being passed to the D3.js source code.
A total of <span class="math inline">\(N = 30\)</span> points <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i), i = 1,...N\)</span> were generated for <span class="math inline">\(x\in [x_{min}, x_{max}]\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> have an exponential relationship.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Discussion and Conclusion</h2>
<p>The intent of this chapter was to establish you draw it as a tool for testing graphics then use this tool to determine the cognitive implications of displaying data on the log scale.
Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era replicated the results found in <span class="citation">Mosteller, Siegel, Trapido, &amp; Youtz (1981)</span>.
When shown points following a linear trend, participants tended to fit the slope of the first principal component over the slope of the least squares regression line.
This trend was most prominent when shown data simulated with larger variances.
The reproducibility of these results serve as evidence of the reliability of the you draw it method.</p>
<p>In Prediction of Exponential Trends, the you draw it method was used to test an individual’s ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data.
Results indicate that underestimation of exponential growth occurs when participants were asked to draw trend lines on the linear scale and that there was an improvement in accuracy when trends were drawn on the log scale.
This phenomena is strongly supported for high exponential growth rates.
Improvement in predictions are made when points along the exponential trend are shown as indicated by the discrepancy in results for treatments with points truncated at 50% compared to 75% of the domain.</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest that there are cognitive advantages to log scales when making predictions of exponential trends.
Improvement in predictions were made for trends with high exponential growth rates when participants were asked to draw a trend line on the log scale compared to the linear scale.
Further investigation is necessary to determine the implications of using log scales when translating exponential graphs to numerical values.</p>
